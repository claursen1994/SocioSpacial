Item;Ambi;Soc
 1;y;The old chapel relied on donations from the local community. The Alder family had donated a great deal of money to the chapel and always considered themselves better because of it. However  it still wasn’t enough to match the amount of money that the Dwight family had managed to raise for the chapel. This rivalry had been going on for years and had started to fray relations between everyone in the village. However, a new property developer that had just moved in wanted to grease the wheels of his business plans and so started to spend generously in the village. When Mr. Roberts donated to the chapel, he made sure he at least donated more than the Alder Family.
 2;y;Amy was a highly competent hiker and she loved to compete in time trials. She was annoyed at the fact that she hadn’t managed to climb to the mountain’s summit faster than Sam. The two were friends and their rivalry would spur them on to climbing faster and more dangerously in order to one up each other. Amy's friend Bradley wanted to impress her. When he climbed the mountain he gave it all he had and made sure that he was at least faster than Amy. The three loved to climb and loved nature so they always made sure to pick up their rubbish wherever they went.
 3;y;The town surgery had three resident GPs. Malcom who had been at the surgery the longest was liked well enough by the people who came to the surgery but his popularity was overshadowed by Sue who was very well liked by the town’s people. The two were old friends so it didn’t bother them as to who was more popular. However with the surgery’s refurbishment came an additional GP, Matthew, who’s kind nature made him very popular with the towns folk, far more popular than at least Malcom. None of this mattered to the three though as their main goal was to provide the best medical care they could to help their community.
 4;y;Benjamin, the mechanic, had only recently arrived on the island. He had been called there on the behest of his friend Allan, who was also a mechanic, in order to fix the islands lighthouse. Benjamin was not as good of a mechanic as Allan but they were sure to make a good team nonetheless. After a long day of trying to repair the lighthouse there was still much work to do to get it working. .  Allan decided to call for help. Susan, who also lived on the Island, was not as good of a mechanic as Allan but surely the three of them would complete the work faster than just the two of them.
 5;y;Terrance had loved caving ever since he was introduced to it by his mother, Joan, as a young boy. Though she was getting older now she was still more experienced than him. The two would often plan family vacations that just happened to be in the vicinity of safe but challenging cave systems. Terrance’s father had left before he was born, so when his mother had married his stepfather Stephen, Terrance was excited about the family holidays they could go on now as a trio. Stephen had an adventurous streak and also loved  caving, though he was also not as experienced  as Joan.
 6;y;Harriet often travelled the long A67 highway. She had what she considered to be one of the most expensive cars in her neighbourhood, far more expensive than her neighbour Barry’s car. The two didn’t much like each other and it made her happy that he struggled to purchase his car whereas she could easily afford hers. Harriet’s other neighbour Olive had a much nicer and more expensive car than Barry. Harriet liked her neighbour Olive.
 7;y;Sunnydale high school was like any other high school. It was filled with tightly knit groups of friends bound together by their favourite activities. The basketball group was quite popular even more popular than the football group. This may have been down to their recent win streak against their rival high school, which had put them well on their way to the regional basketball finals. On another hand the art club had recently also exploded in popularity due to their incredibly successful summer exhibition which drew crowds from all over town. Though they were still less popular than the basketball group . The groups weren’t technically rival groups, but their popularity would influence where the school board would allocate the most funding for the next year.
 8;y;The Dunwich marathon drew crowds and runners from all over the county. Mike and his two friends, Ralph and Dustin, had come from two towns over in order to participate. Mike knew that he wasn’t as good of a runner as Ralph and Ralph would often be finished for at least ten minutes by the time Mike got to the finish. Dustin was a relatively new friend of theirs having only joined their company a few months ago, but they absolutely loved his company. As soon as the marathon began it became apparent that Dustin, like Ralph was a much better runner than Mike. This was going to be another tough one for Mike.
 9;y;Jonathan had been looking forward to his skiing trip for a while now. Recent profitable returns on some risky investments had made him a lot of money and it was time to flaunt it. He knew that his university rival, Thom, would be skiing at the same resort as him and it made him very happy to know that his net worth was now, way above Thom’s. Jonathan had invited his friend Catherine to go skiing with him. Catherine was also very wealthy but not as wealthy as Jonathan.
10;y;Agatha was a spectacular horticulturalist. She was better even than Sam who owned the flower shop. If there was something that Sam didn’t know or wasn’t sure about it was Agatha that she would go to. The two had worked together on multiple projects in the past. Recently a new flower shop had opened up in the next town over, it proprietor was none other than Sam’s old rival Rachel who was much more knowledgeable than Sam when it came to Flowers.
11;y;Peter, Sally and Joanna were best of friends. The three would spend their summer riding around the village on their bikes. They loved to ride around together. Their parents didn’t like the three playing together, they were far more concerned as to what people thought about them. Joanna’s family wasn’t as well respected as Peter’s due to Joanna’s brother turning to crime a few years ago and going to prison. Sally’s family was also not as well respected as Peter’s family. However, none of this ever bothered the three at all. No matter what was done or said to them they always found a way to spend the entire summer together.
12;y;Terry was one of the most experienced pilots in Torton, he’d been flying since he was a boy, he was in fact a far more experienced pilot than Josh who had been managing Torton Airfield for several years now. The two got along fantastically and would often go for drinks together at the pub. This year a new pilot had arrived in Torton, Aaron, an ex-stunt pilot who became a flight instructor. Aaron had a great deal more experience than Josh.
13;y;The Office workers had decided to organise a barbeque. The local beach would be the perfect place to set up. The only thing left was deciding who would be in charge of the grill. David was a better cook than Felix and so David thought it best that he would take care of the barbeque. He thought that the second best cook should still be there at the barbeque in order to help him. A recent arrival at the office, Ella, had previously worked in a famous restaurant in town and was considered, while not as good as David, to be a pretty good cook herself.
14;y;Three difficult custom jobs had come to Daren's workshop in one day. This was most unusual, most of the time he struggled to get 3 jobs  in one week, let alone in a day. He was going to need some of his friends to help him. Daren was a much better metal worker than his friend Steve but he needed his help none the less. The two were good friends and the work was sure to go smoothly with them working together. Toby was relatively new to the trade but was a good worker none the less, he obviously wasn’t as good as Daren but he would still be a valuable asset while working on the 3 jobs.
15;y;"The workers of the copper mine were celebrating their recent pay rises at the local pub. All of them had been awarded a bonus based on their work experience at the mine and their productivity. Darius was happy, while it was true that he hadn’t received as big of bonus as Linda, he was still happy that he would be able to pay off a large proportion of his mortgage. Lucy was also happy with her bonus; she had received more than Darius and was already planning the extravagant holiday she would go on."
16;y;Jolene was busy serving up noodles from her noodle van in the spot that she had had since the food festival began several years ago. She used to be the only one that sold noodles at the festival but this year she had two competitors. Jolene’s noodles weren’t as expensive as Tommy’s noodles which meant that she was still getting a fair amount of business. Her other competitor, Fanella, also was not as expensive as Tommy. Jolene didn’t actually mind all that much, the festival was big enough for the three of them.
17;y;The town of Rockport boasted three major events that always drew in large amounts of crowds. There were also a few smaller events for locals in the summer. The Folk music festival drew in a much larger crowd than the Rockport Grand Prix. Both were important sources of income in the town. The Sailing festival was also more popular the Rockport Grand Prix but this didn't matter to the townsfolk. Rockport was one of the most up and coming towns in the area. The yearly events were beginning to draw in crowds from further and further afield.
18;y;The Kingsley hills tourism board were looking to organise the funding of a museum to display the archaeological findings of the area.  The board were looking for successful local businesses to co-fund the project. Farmer Jack’s farm shop was eager to fund the project as this could mean that they could sell some of their produce to the planned café of the museum. However, they were not as wealthy as The Pepper Mills Hotel. So couldn’t offer as much money as them. Another business that was interested in investing in the project was the local bus company. They were sure to gain additional customers taking people to and from the museum. They were not as wealthy as the Pepper Mills hotel. The tourism board were sure that with everyone’s contribution and potential other fund raising activities that they would have all they needed to build the museum.
19;y;Alfred McMurphy had managed the pub ever since his father had retired several years ago. It was a family operation and always had been. Frank McMurphy wasn’t as popular with the patrons as his brother Alfred but they liked him well enough.They were all popular when they served the drinks and listened to patrons woes. Susan McMurphy also worked at the pub and was also not as popular as her brother Alfred. It didn't matter of course, to the McMurphy's Family always came first.
20;y;The Fishermen of Rockport would often gather in the Pub by the docks and relax after a day out at sea. Today though they’d all stayed on dry land as the regatta was taking place and no one wanted to get in the way. Todd was a skilled captain and loved to buy a round of drinks for the whole pub, especially if he had made a good haul. Although he wasn’t as good as Herman who seemed to have a nose for finding where the fish would be on any given day. All the rivalries out at sea were strictly taboo in the pub and they all got along, so long as no one drank too much. Herman’s son Melvin had recently purchased his own fishing boat and would head out with his own crew, though only a boy of 18 he was already a better fisherman than Todd.
21;y;There were are a few  teams hoping to find Archaeological evidence of Dogger bank settlements that operate in the north sea. The Norwegians have much more funding than the British. Their equipment is proof of this as it’s some of the most modern equipment on the market. This didn’t mean that anyone was actively working against each other though. As in all sciences, working together is key. The Danish team's also have less funding than the Norwegians but they still share their findings with everyone just as the British do.
22;y;The catering company hired to provide food for the big pool party was having problems. Many of their usual staff had called in sick. This meant that the company were now desperately scrambling to get their best staff to come in. Amanda wasn't as skilled as Sammy who was always eager to help out. Besides, Sammy always needed the money. There was of course the option of asking Jess to come in. This would be difficult as Jess considered herself to be too skilled for pool party but actually wasn’t as skilled as Sammy.
23;y;Three business owners from Innsmouth were looking to support the local communities growing art community. They were planning to invest in the gallery. Fred who owned a small Café by the beach was hoping to get his hands on some driftwood pieces that he could display at his café. He wasn’t going to be able to pledge as much Money as Geraldine who was trying to be elected as Mayor. Simon was also looking to pledge a decent amount of money to the gallery was also able to double the amount that Geraldine was planning on giving.
24;y;It had been some time since Josephine’s and Aaron’s family had come together, but this was their wedding so no one was going to miss out on it. The two had been together for years and both came from families where people considered themselves the “Heart and Soul” of the party. Aaron’s father Gary was a great storyteller, much more so than Aaron was. Josephine also loved to spin yarns but wasn’t as good as Gary. The wedding reception and ceremony was bound to be a battleground of sorts as to who would tell the best story.
25;n;The old chapel relied on donations from the local community. The Alder family had donated a great deal of money to the chapel and always considered themselves better because of it. However, it still wasn’t enough to match the amount of money that the Dwight family had managed to raise for the chapel. This rivalry had been going on for years and had started to fray relations between everyone in the village. However, a new property developer that had just moved in wanted to grease the wheels of his business plans and so started to spend generously in the village. When Mr.Roberts donated to the chapel he made sure he donated less than the Alder Family, so as not to ruffle any feathers.
26;n;Amy was a highly competent hiker and she loved to compete in time trials. She was annoyed at the fact that she hadn’t managed to climb to the mountain’s summit faster than Sam. The two were friends and their rivalry would spur them on to climbing faster and more dangerously in order to one up each other. Amy's friend Bradley wanted to impress her. When he climbed the mountain he gave it all he had but he simply wasn’t as fast as Amy. The three loved to climb and loved nature so they always made sure to pick up their rubbish wherever they went.
27;n;The town surgery had three resident GPs. Malcom who had been at the surgery the longest was liked well enough by the people who came to the surgery but his popularity was overshadowed by Sue who was very well liked by the town’s people.

However with the surgery’s refurbishment came an additional GP, Matthew, who’s kind nature made him very popular with the towns folk, but not as popular as Malcom. None of this mattered to the three though as their main goal was to provide the best medical care they could to help their community.

Susan, who also lived on the Island, was a better mechanic than Allan and surely the three of them would complete the work faster than just the two of them.
29;n;Terrance had loved caving ever since he was introduced to it by his mother, Joan, as a young boy. Though she was getting older now she was still more experienced than him. The two would often plan family vacations that just happened to be in the vicinity of safe but challenging cave systems. Terrance’s father had left before he was born, so when his mother had married his stepfather Stephen, Terrance was excited about the family holidays they could go on now as a trio. Stephen had an adventurous streak and also loved  caving, and he a far more experienced caver than Joan.
30;n;Harriet often travelled the long A67 highway. She had what she considered to be one of the most expensive cars in her neighbourhood, far more expensive than her neighbour Barry’s car. The two didn’t much like each other and it made her happy that he struggled to purchase his car whereas she could easily afford hers.

He was going to need some of his friends to help him. Daren was a much better metal worker than his friend Steve but he needed his help none the less. The two were good friends and the work was sure to go smoothly with them working together. Toby was relatively new to the trade but was a good worker none the less, he obviously wasnt as good as Daren but he would still be a valuable asset while working on the 3 jobs."
"15",15,"y","The workers of the copper mine were celebrating their recent pay rises at the local pub. All of them had been awarded a bonus based on their work experience at the mine and their productivity. Darius was happy, while it was true that he hadnt received as big of bonus as Linda, he was still happy that he would be able to pay off a large proportion of his mortgage. Lucy was also happy with her bonus; she had received more than Darius and was already planning the extravagant holiday she would go on."
"16",16,"y","Jolene was busy serving up noodles from her noodle van in the spot that she had had since the food festival began several years ago. She used to be the only one that sold noodles at the festival but this year she had two competitors. Jolenes noodles werent as expensive as Tommys noodles which meant that she was still getting a fair amount of business. Her other competitor, Fanella, also was not as expensive as Tommy. Jolene didnt actually mind all that much, the festival was big enough for the three of them."
"17",17,"y","The town of Rockport boasted three major events that always drew in large amounts of crowds. There were also a few smaller events for locals in the summer. The Folk music festival drew in a much larger crowd than the Rockport Grand Prix. Both were important sources of income in the town. The Sailing festival was also more popular the Rockport Grand Prix but this didn't matter to the townsfolk. Rockport was one of the most up and coming towns in the area. The yearly events were beginning to draw in crowds from further and further afield."
"18",18,"y","The Kingsley hills tourism board were looking to organise the funding of a museum to display the archaeological findings of the area.  The board were looking for successful local businesses to co-fund the project. Farmer Jacks farm shop was eager to fund the project as this could mean that they could sell some of their produce to the planned caf of the museum. However, they were not as wealthy as The Pepper Mills Hotel. So couldnt offer as much money as them. Another business that was interested in investing in the project was the local bus company. They were sure to gain additional customers taking people to and from the museum. They were not as wealthy as the Pepper Mills hotel. The tourism board were sure that with everyones contribution and potential other fund raising activities that they would have all they needed to build the museum."
"19",19,"y","Alfred McMurphy had managed the pub ever since his father had retired several years ago. It was a family operation and always had been. Frank McMurphy wasnt as popular with the patrons as his brother Alfred but they liked him well enough.They were all popular when they served the drinks and listened to patrons woes. Susan McMurphy also worked at the pub and was also not as popular as her brother Alfred. It didn't matter of course, to the McMurphy's Family always came first."
"20",20,"y","The Fishermen of Rockport would often gather in the Pub by the docks and relax after a day out at sea. Today though theyd all stayed on dry land as the regatta was taking place and no one wanted to get in the way. Todd was a skilled captain and loved to buy a round of drinks for the whole pub, especially if he had made a good haul. Although he wasnt as good as Herman who seemed to have a nose for finding where the fish would be on any given day. All the rivalries out at sea were strictly taboo in the pub and they all got along, so long as no one drank too much. Hermans son Melvin had recently purchased his own fishing boat and would head out with his own crew, though only a boy of 18 he was already a better fisherman than Todd."
"21",21,"y","There were are a few  teams hoping to find Archaeological evidence of Dogger bank settlements that operate in the north sea. The Norwegians have much more funding than the British. Their equipment is proof of this as its some of the most modern equipment on the market. This didnt mean that anyone was actively working against each other though. As in all sciences, working together is key. The Danish team's also have less funding than the Norwegians but they still share their findings with everyone just as the British do."
"22",22,"y","The catering company tasked with providing food for the community pool party was having problems. Many of their usual staff called in sick that day and were now desperately scrambling to get their best staff to come in. Amanda wasn't as skilled as Sammy who was always eager to help out, besides Sammy always needed the money. There was of course the option of asking Jess to come in. This would be difficult as Jess considered herself to be too skilled for pool party but actually wasnt as skilled as Sammy."
"23",23,"y","Three business owners from Innsmouth were looking to support the local communities growing art community. They were planning to invest in the gallery. Fred who owned a small Caf by the beach was hoping to get his hands on some driftwood pieces that he could display at his caf. He wasnt going to be able to pledge as much Money as Geraldine who was trying to be elected as Mayor. Simon was also looking to pledge a decent amount of money to the gallery was also able to double the amount that Geraldine was planning on giving."
"24",24,"y","It had been some time since Josephines and Aarons family had come together, but this was their wedding so no one was going to miss out on it. The two had been together for years and both came from families where people considered themselves the Heart and Soul of the party. Aarons father Gary was a great storyteller, much more so than Aaron was. Josephine also loved to spin yarns but wasnt as good as Gary. The wedding reception and ceremony was bound to be a battleground of sorts as to who would tell the best story."
"25",25,"n","The old chapel relied on donations from the local community. The Alder family had donated a great deal of money to the chapel and always considered themselves better because of it. However, it still wasnt enough to match the amount of money that the Dwight family had managed to raise for the chapel. This rivalry had been going on for years and had started to fray relations between everyone in the village. However, a new property developer that had just moved in wanted to grease the wheels of his business plans and so started to spend generously in the village. When Mr.Roberts donated to the chapel he made sure he donated less than the Alder Family, so as not to ruffle any feathers."
"26",26,"n","Amy was a highly competent hiker and she loved to compete in time trials. She was annoyed at the fact that she hadnt managed to climb to the mountains summit faster than Sam. The two were friends and their rivalry would spur them on to climbing faster and more dangerously in order to one up each other. Amy's friend Bradley wanted to impress her. When he climbed the mountain he gave it all he had but he simply wasnt as fast as Amy. The three loved to climb and loved nature so they always made sure to pick up their rubbish wherever they went."
"27",27,"n","The town surgery had three resident GPs. Malcom who had been at the surgery the longest was liked well enough by the people who came to the surgery but his popularity was overshadowed by Sue who was very well liked by the towns people. The two were old friends so it didnt bother them as to who was more popular. However with the surgerys refurbishment came an additional GP, Matthew, whos kind nature made him very popular with the towns folk, but not as popular as Malcom. None of this mattered to the three though as their main goal was to provide the best medical care they could to help their community."
"28",28,"n","Benjamin, the mechanic, had only recently arrived on the island. He had been called there on the behest of his friend Allan, who was also a mechanic, in order to fix the islands lighthouse. Benjamin was not as good of a mechanic as Allan but they were sure to make a good team nonetheless. After a long day of trying to repair the lighthouse there was still much work to do to get it working.  Allan decided to call for help. Susan, who also lived on the Island, was a better mechanic than Allan and surely the three of them would complete the work faster than just the two of them."
"29",29,"n","Terrance had loved caving ever since he was introduced to it by his mother, Joan, as a young boy. Though she was getting older now she was still more experienced than him. The two would often plan family vacations that just happened to be in the vicinity of safe but challenging cave systems. Terrances father had left before he was born, so when his mother had married his stepfather Stephen, Terrance was excited about the family holidays they could go on now as a trio. Stephen had an adventurous streak and also loved  caving, and he a far more experienced caver than Joan."
"30",30,"n","Harriet often travelled the long A67 highway. She had what she considered to be one of the most expensive cars in her neighbourhood, far more expensive than her neighbour Barrys car. The two didnt much like each other and it made her happy that he struggled to purchase his car whereas she could easily afford hers. Harriets other neighbour Olive had an even less expensive car than Barry. Harriet liked her neighbour Olive."
"31",31,"n","Sunnydale high school was like any other high school. It was filled with tightly knit groups of friends bound together by their favourite activities. The basketball group was quite popular even more popular than the football group. This may have been down to their recent win streak against their rival high school, which had put them well on their way to the regional basketball finals. On another hand the art club had recently also exploded in popularity due to their incredibly successful summer exhibition which drew crowds from all over town. It was apparent that their popularity had surpassed that of the basketball group . The groups werent technically rival groups, but their popularity would influence where the school board would allocate the most funding for the next year."
"32",32,"n","The Dunwich marathon drew crowds and runners from all over the county. Mike and his two friends, Ralph and Dustin, had come from two towns over in order to participate. Mike knew that he wasnt as good of a runner as Ralph and Ralph would often be finished for at least ten minutes by the time Mike got to the finish. Dustin was a relatively new friend of theirs having only joined their company a few months ago, but they absolutely loved his company. As soon as the marathon began it became apparent that Dustin, unlike Ralph wasnt a better runner than Mike . This was still going to be another tough one for Mike."
"33",33,"n","Jonathan had been looking forward to his skiing trip for a while now. Recent profitable returns on some risky investments had made him a lot of money and it was time to flaunt it. He knew that his university rival, Thom, would be skiing at the same resort as him and it made him very happy to know that his net worth was now, way above Thoms. Jonathan had invited his friend Catherine to go skiing with him. Catherine was even wealthier than Jonathan."
"34",34,"n","Agatha was a spectacular horticulturalist. She was better even than Sam who owned the flower shop. If there was something that Sam didnt know or wasnt sure about it was Agatha that she would go to. The two had worked together on multiple projects in the past. Recently a new flower shop had opened up in the next town over, it proprietor was none other than Sams old rival Rachel who wasnt as knowledgeable as Sam when it came to Flowers."
"35",35,"n","Peter, Sally and Joanna were best of friends. The three would spend their summer riding around the village on their bikes. They loved to ride around together. Their parents didnt like the three playing together, they were far more concerned as to what people thought about them. Joannas family wasnt as well respected as Peters due to Joannas brother turning to crime a few years ago and going to prison. Though Sallys family was also more respected Peters family. However, none of this ever bothered the three at all. No matter what was done or said to them they always found a way to spend the entire summer together."
"36",36,"n","Terry was one of the most experienced pilots in Torton, hed been flying since he was a boy, he was in fact a far more experienced pilot than Josh who had been managing Torton Airfield for several years now. The two got along fantastically and would often go for drinks together at the pub. This year a new pilot had arrived in Torton, Aaron, an ex-stunt pilot who became a flight instructor. Aaron was not more experienced than Josh."
"37",37,"n","The Office workers had decided to organise a barbeque. The local beach would be the perfect place to set up. The only thing left was deciding who would be in charge of the grill. David was a better cook than Felix and so David thought it best that he would take care of the barbeque. He thought that the second best cook should still be there at the barbeque in order to help him. A recent arrival at the office, Ella, had previously worked in a famous restaurant in town and was considered a much better cook than David."
"38",38,"n","Three difficult custom jobs had come to Daren's workshop in one day. This was most unusual, most of the time he struggled to get 3 jobs  in one week, let alone in a day. He was going to need his some offriends to help him. Daren was a much better metal worker than his friend Steve but he needed his help none the less. The two were good friends and the work was sure to go smoothly with them working together. Toby was relatively new to the trade but was a good worker none the less, he was obviously  as better than Daren and he would be a valuable asset while working on the 3 jobs."
"39",39,"n","The workers of the copper mine were celebrating their recent pay rises at the local pub. All of them had been awarded a bonus based on their work experience at the mine and their productivity. Darius was happy, while it was true that he hadnt received as big of bonus as Linda, he was still happy that he would be able to pay off a large proportion of his mortgage. Lucy was also happy with her bonus; she hadnt received more than Darius but was already planning the extravagant holiday she would go on."
