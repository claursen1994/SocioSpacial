 1;y;The old chapel relied on donations from the local community. The Alder family had donated a great deal of money to the chapel. However, it still wasn't enough to match the amount of money that the Dwight family had managed to raise for the chapel. However, a new property developer that had just moved in wanted to grease the wheels of his business plans and so started to spend generously in the village. When Mr.Roberts donated to the chapel, he donated more than the Alder Family.
 2;y;Amy was a highly competent hiker and she loved to compete in time trials. She was annoyed at the fact that she hadn't managed to climb to the mountain's summit faster than Sam. The two were friends and their rivalry would spur them on to climbing faster and more dangerously in order to one up each other. Amy's friend Bradley wanted to impress her. When he climbed the mountain he gave it all he had and made sure that he was at least faster than Amy. The three loved to climb and loved nature so they always made sure to pick up their rubbish wherever they went.
 3;y;The town surgery had three resident GPs. Malcom who had been at the surgery the longest was liked well enough by the people who came to the surgery but his popularity was overshadowed by Sue who was very well liked by patients. With the surgery's refurbishment came a third GP, Matthew, whose kind nature made him very popular with the townsfolk, more popular than at Malcom. It didn't matter to them though as their main goal was to provide the best medical care they could to help their community.
 4;y;Benjamin, the mechanic, had only just arrived on the island. He had been called there on the behest of his friend Allan, who was also a mechanic, to fix the island's lighthouse. Benjamin was not as good of a mechanic as Allan. After a long day of trying to repair the lighthouse there was still much work to do to get it working. Allan decided to call for help. Susan, who also lived on the Island, was not as good of a mechanic as Allan but surely the three of them would complete the work faster than just the two of them.
 5;y;Terrance had loved caving ever since he was introduced to it by his mother, Joan. Though she was getting older now she was still more experienced than him. The two would often plan family vacations that just happened to be in the vicinity of safe but challenging cave systems. Terrance's father had left before he was born, so when his mother had married his stepfather Stephen, Terrance was excited about the family holidays they could go on now as a trio. Stephen had an adventurous streak and also loved caving, though he was also not as experienced as Joan.
 6;y;Harriet often travelled the long A67 highway. She had what she considered to be one of the most expensive cars in her neighbourhood, far more expensive than her neighbour Barry's car. Harriet was arrogant and boastful so it made her happy that he struggled to purchase his car whereas she could easily afford hers. Harriet's other neighbour Olive had a much nicer and more expensive car than Barry. Harriet enjoyed washing her car every weekend.
 7;y;Sunnydale high school was like any high school. The basketball group was quite popular even more popular than the football group. This may have been down to their recent win streak against their rival high school, which had put them on their way to the basketball finals. On another hand the art club had recently also exploded in popularity due to their very successful summer exhibition. Though they were still less popular than the basketball group. Their popularity would influence how many members each group had
 8;y;The Dunwich marathon drew from all over the county. Mike and his two friends, Ralph and Dustin, had come from two towns over to participate. Mike knew that he wasn't as good of a runner as Ralph. Dustin was a relatively new friend of theirs having only joined their company a few months ago, but they absolutely loved him. As soon as the marathon began it became apparent that Dustin, like Ralph was a much better runner than Mike. This was going to be another tough one for Mike.
 9;y;Jonathan had been looking forward to his skiing trip for a while now. Recent profitable returns on some risky investments had made him a lot of money and it was time to flaunt it. He knew that his university rival, Thom, would be skiing at the same resort as him and it made him very happy to know that his net worth was now, way above Thom's. Jonathan had invited his childhood friend Catherine to go skiing with him. Catherine had been born very wealthy but not as wealthy as Jonathan.
10;y;Agatha was a spectacular horticulturalist. She was better even than Sam who owned the flower shop. If there was something that Sam didn't know or wasn't sure about it was Agatha that she would go to. The two had worked together on multiple projects in the past. Recently a new flower shop had opened up in the next town over, its proprietor was none other than Sam's old rival Rachel who was much more knowledgeable than Sam when it came to Flowers.
11;y;Peter, Sally and Joanna were best of friends. They Loved to play together. Their parents didn't like the three playing together, they were far more concerned as to what people thought about them. Joanna's family wasn't as well respected as Peter's due to Joanna's brother turning to crime a few years ago and going to prison. Sally's family was also not as well respected as Peter's family. However, none of this ever bothered the three at all. No matter what was done or said to them they always found a way to spend the entire summer together.
12;y;Terry was one of the most experienced pilots in Torton, he'd been flying since he was a boy, he was in fact a far more experienced pilot than Josh who had been managing Torton Airfield for several years now. The two got along fantastically and would often go for drinks together at the pub. This year a new pilot had arrived in Torton, Aaron, an ex-stunt pilot who became a flight instructor. Aaron had a great deal more experience than Josh.
13;y;The office workers had decided to organise a barbeque. The local beach would be the perfect place to set up. The only thing left was deciding who would be in charge of the grill. Everyone knew David was a better cook than Felix. It would be a big responsibility to ensure that the fine quality meats which had been ordered were cooked to perfection. A recent arrival at the office, Ella, had previously worked in agriculture and was considered to be not as good a cook as David.
14;y;Three difficult custom jobs had come to Daren's workshop in one day. This was most unusual, most of the time he struggled to get 3 jobs in one week, let alone in a day. He was going to need some help. Daren was a much better metal worker than his friend Steve but he needed his help none the less. They were friends and the work was sure to go smoothly. Toby was relatively new to the trade but was a good worker none the less, he obviously wasn't as good as Daren but he would still be a valuable asset while working on the 3 jobs.
15;y;The workers of the copper mine were celebrating their recent pay rises at the local pub. All of them had been awarded a bonus based on their work experience at the mine and their productivity. Darius was happy, while it was true that he hadn't received as big of bonus as Belinda, he was still happy that he would be able to pay off a large proportion of his mortgage. Lucy was also happy with her bonus, she had received more than Darius and was already planning the extravagant holiday she would go on.
16;y;Jolene was busy serving up noodles from her noodle van in the spot that she had had since the food festival began several years ago. She used to be the only one that sold noodles at the festival but this year she had two competitors. Jolene's noodles weren't as expensive as Tommy's noodles which meant that she was still getting a fair amount of business. Her other competitor, Fanella, also was not as expensive as Tommy. Jolene didn't actually mind all that much, the festival was big enough for the three of them.
17;y;The town of Rockport boasted three major events that always drew in large amounts of crowds. There were also a few smaller events for locals in the summer. The Folk music festival drew in a much larger crowd than the Rockport Grand Prix. Both were important sources of income in the town. The Sailing festival was also more popular the Rockport Grand Prix but this didn't matter to the townsfolk. Rockport was one of the most up and coming towns in the area. The yearly events were beginning to draw in crowds from further and further afield.
18;y;The Kingsley hills tourism board were looking to build a museum to display the archaeological findings of the area. The board were looking for local businesses to co-fund the project. Farmer Jack's farm shop was eager to fund the project. However, Farmer Jack's were not as wealthy as The Pepper Mills Hotel. So couldn't offer as much money as them.The local bus company also wanted to co-fund the project. They were not as wealthy as the Pepper Mills hotel. The tourism board were sure that they would have all they needed to build the museum.
19;y;Alfred McMurphy had managed the pub ever since his father had retired several years ago. It was a family operation and always had been. Frank McMurphy wasn't as popular with the patrons as his brother Alfred but they liked him well enough. They were all popular when they served the drinks and listened to patrons' woes. Susan McMurphy also worked at the pub and was also not as popular as her brother Alfred. It didn't matter of course, to the McMurphy's Family always came first.
20;y;The Fishermen of Rockport would often gather in the Pub by the docks and relax after a day out at sea. Today though they'd all stayed on dry land as the regatta was taking place and no one wanted to get in the way. Todd was a skilled captain and loved to buy a round of drinks for the whole pub. Although he wasn't as good as Herman. Herman's son Melvin had recently purchased his own fishing boat and would head out with his own crew, though only a boy of 18 he was already a better fisherman than Todd.
21;y;There are a few teams hoping to find Archaeological evidence of Dogger bank settlements that operate in the north sea. The Norwegians have much more funding than the British. Their equipment is proof of this as it's some of the most modern equipment on the market. This didn't mean that anyone was actively working against each other though. As in all sciences, working together is key. The Danish team's also have less funding than the Norwegians but they still share their findings with everyone just as the British do.
22;y;The catering company hired to provide food for the big pool party was having problems. Many of their usual staff had called in sick. This meant that the company were now desperately scrambling to get their best staff to come in. Amanda wasn't as skilled as Sammy who was always eager to help out. Besides, Sammy always needed the money. There was of course the option of asking Jess to come in. Jess wasn't as skilled as Sammy. The catering company boss hoped everything would run smoothly.
23;y;Three business owners from Innsmouth were looking to support the local communities growing art community. They were planning to invest in the gallery. Fred who owned a small Café by the beach was hoping to get his hands on some driftwood pieces that he could display at his café. He wasn't going to be able to pledge as much Money as Geraldine who was trying to be elected as Mayor. Simon was also looking to pledge a decent amount of money to the gallery but was also not really able to match the amount that Geraldine was planning on giving.
24;y;It had been some time since Josephine's and Aaron's family had come together, but this was their wedding so no one was going to miss out on it. The two had been together for years and both came from families where people considered themselves the heart and soul of the party. Aaron's father Gary was a great storyteller, much more so than Aaron was. Josephine also loved to spin yarns but wasn't as good as Gary. The wedding reception and ceremony was bound to be a battleground of sorts as to who would tell the best story.
25;y;Naomi had always been curious about the many abandoned pieces of equipment that littered the fields around her home. She was very brave for her age but wasn't as brave as her little sister Jane. Jane could find adventure where ever she went. Sometimes, when their older brother Will came home from school, the three would go off exploring the countryside together. Will wasn't as brave as Jane but they loved to pretend that they were explorers in some vast unknown land.
26;y;The three women had long wanted to put the sailing skills they'd learned in their youth to good use. Holly was a much better sailor than Vicky, because Holly had learned to sail from her father at a young age. Julie on the other hand wasn't as good at sailing as Vicky as she had only moved to Plum Island in her teenage years. Despite the differences in their abilities, the three loved to race one another and truly test themselves against the strong winds of the Atlantic.
