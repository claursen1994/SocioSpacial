 1;y;The old chapel doors stood wide open allowing full view of its interior. Inside there stood a magnificent altar that had been in the church for hundreds of years. To the left of the alter stood the pulpit where the pastor would often hold his sermons from. A recent Archaeological discovery has led researchers to believe that there is a secret underground chamber somewhere to the right of the pulpit in the church. The local community considered the church an integral part of its identity, though the number of people attending had dwindled significantly over the past few years.
 2;y;The mountain stood proudly as it had done for thousands of years. People had always wanted to climb it so over the years a natural rest stop had developed above the camp at the mountain’s base. The rest stop wasn’t an official one and had over the years become popular with bird watchers. They had no interest in reaching the summit as it was the birds they came for. With a recent increase in tourism on the mountain there was a rumour that somewhere above the camp at the mountain’s base there was a small area where people would go to throw their rubbish away. The mountain rangers' authority found this to be completely unacceptable.
 3;y;The newly refurbished town surgery was finally ready to reopen after a whole month of being closed. The surgery was located in front of a small play park surrounded by a large car park that was used for local shopping. The surgery boasted a great deal more space than it had before, several smaller buildings around were now used to house non-medical tools such as cleaning equipment. The cleaner would keep his floor polisher in a shed somewhere behind the surgery. The cleaner had worked at the surgery for as long as anyone could remember and he himself was also quite old.
 4;y;Spice Island lay just three nautical miles off the coast Newfoundland. The island didn’t have a great deal to offer in terms of comfort but there were a handful of people that called it home. There was a small weather station to the left the small docks used mostly to load and unload supplies as well as passengers. There was also a small supply store somewhere to the left of the docks which sold various bits and pieces. It was overpriced due to the fact that spice islanders had to import everything from the mainland. Many of them didn’t mind spending more on supplies if it meant avoiding a long trip to the mainland.
 5;y;The local community had long considered the caves at the bottom of the Lincoln gorge dangerous. However, the tourist industry just kept growing. An adventure holiday company had set up a seasoned cavers activity with a rest stop in a large cave somewhere below the entrance. This was usually the only place tourists got to before turning back as the tunnel that went further down was a very tight squeeze. A recent geological survey of the area had determined that there should be a previously undiscovered cavern below the entrance to the caves.
 6;y;The A67 highway was one of the longest roads in the country. It spanned almost all of it, and ran over the river Stig. Heading to Innsmouth from Ipswich people have to cross the bridge over the river. Somewhere before this bridge there was a rest stop that offered travellers bed and breakfast. It was a popular place and saw a great many visitors, making it a profitable place to own. A checkpoint had been set up by the police somewhere before the bridge as there had been reports of drug smuggling in the area.
 7;y;The party hall had been rented out for the high school’s prom. The theme was 1950’s and the hall had been decorated accordingly with bunting and posters from the era. To the right of the table with snacks and refreshments stood a photo booth, where students could have their pictures taken in their fancy dress consumes. Somewhere to the left of the photo booth stood a table where students could write their well wishes to their fellow students, teachers, parents or anyone that had helped them get through the year. All the tickets for the prom had sold out almost immediately, it was set to be the biggest event in the school calendar.
 8;y;The marathon was held every year in Dunwich. Every runner had to have a charity for which they were running. Most of the time the runners that ran for a big charity would run in a group together in order to stand out more for the crowds that gathered along the roads. The runners of the local hospice knew they were behind the runners of the wildlife charity. It didn’t matter who won of course so long as money was raised and everyone had fun. The runners from the cancer charity knew they were in front of the runners from the hospice, which encouraged them. It would be a spectacular finish with a great deal of money raised for charity.
 9;y;High up in the mountains, where the snow rarely melts, is a world famous ski resort. The resort caters almost exclusively to the incredibly wealthy. It has some of the finest hotels and restaurants in the world. The slope everyone at the resort desired to be seen on was above one of the more exclusive ski lodges. People had to take a special pre-booked shuttle bus to get to the lodge itself and then wait to be invited to ski on the slope. Though the lodge couldn’t actually stop anyone from skiing on the slope, they were responsible for its upkeep and safety. A child has gone missing below the start of the slope and hadn’t been seen in several hours.
10;y;The flower shop on Wensley High Street was by far the most popular shop in town. People said it had the best variety of plants on offer. To the right of display of pre-cut flowers was an arrangement of succulents that would change every week. It was one of the reasons why the shop was so popular, people loved the fact that they could return weekly and find something completely new. Recently a local prankster had taken to putting fake plastic plants with price tags somewhere to the right of the cut flowers, much to the dismay of anyone unfortunate enough to accidentally purchase them.
11;y;The village of Northport didn’t offer that much in terms of regular amusement but it had some of the best camping around, especially in the summer. Behind the rows of summer lodges was a stream where kids from the village would spend their entire summer. They often played with those that had come to Northport for the camping. Many friendships were forged in and around that stream. Behind the summer lodges stood a monument to a dog that had saved his owners life during a bear attack at the cost of its own.
12;y;The Torton airfield was busy this time of year. Many of the hobby pilots had taken their summer holidays at the exact same time and all wanted to fly. The resident helicopter flight instructor was somewhere above the control tower. He liked to tease the people in the control tower with stunts high in the air that looked like they would end in a crash. The tower couldn’t care less though they were dealing with a landing request from a small biplane that was having a few engine troubles but it was high above them so it had plenty of space, time and speed to be able to make a safe landing.
13;y;The office wasn’t really much of an office, it was more of a warehouse with desks. Somewhere to the left of the office managers desk stood a water cooler. She had placed it there so that she could keep an eye on her underlings so that they wouldn’t be tempted to chat away the whole working day. The air conditioner had recently broken making the office hellishly hot. The manager had placed an order for a large fan so that it would be at least somewhat cooler. She’d made sure that it would be placed somewhere to the right of the watercooler so that she could keep an eye on it and control the settings if she needed to.
14;y;The metal workshop on Yew street had been there in one form or another since the 1500s and as a result had expanded and grown over the many years of operation. In front of a modern lathe stood a desk with a chair that was used as a mini office. This place was more about metal work than paper work but paper work had to be done nonetheless. Workers had recently noticed some small corners of paper had been chewed off which made them suspect that there was a mouse living behind the desk. It couldn’t be in front of the desk simply because that concrete had only recently been repaired.
15;y;The mine had been a source of copper for almost 50 years. It wasn’t particularly big, the company that owned it was small and couldn’t afford to expand. Instead they enjoyed a steady stream of revenue and a constant influx of highly skilled workers that would use the small mine as a way to up their experience in the industry. Shaft-A was currently the most profitable shaft and was situated somewhere below Shaft-B which had run dry a few years ago and was now used as a storage area. A recent exploratory drilling somewhere above Shaft-A and had revealed a good deposit of a very copper rich ore.
16;y;The food and wine festival was held every year on a field between the towns of Swampscott and Lynn. It was growing year on year. To the left of the entrance were several posters for the upcoming events that made the festival special. Along with the usual fare of eating competitions there were sack races, dog shows and live music. Much to the dismay of many attendees, the wine drinking competition would not be held this year. Somewhere to the left of the entrance someone had forgotten their backpack and there were two festival organisers standing next to it discussing whether the backpack constituted a health and safety hazard.
17;y;The Rockport Grand Prix was anything but grand. It was a race track for the under 15s and none of the cars could even go over 40 miles per hour. Not that they would even be able to reach such a speed as the course featured many twists and turns so the soapbox like cars had to go slowly to avoid crashing. The Blue team was one of the best in Rockport and was currently in front of the Red team. The coaches were happy about this as they had to beat the Red and Green team to qualify for the finals. The Green team were also ahead of the Reds. The Grand Prix was always a popular event in Rockport and would draw in onlookers from miles around.
18;y;The Kingsley hills were deemed an area of great archaeological importance. There was a small rest stop somewhere below a small fully excavated dig site. The site had yielded many interesting finds that shed light on the daily lives of early Anglo-Saxon settlers in England. Somewhere downhill of this site was a small patch of grass that never grew quite as tall as the grass around it. This was thought to be evidence of another point of interest and a potential dig site. The archaeological work in the hills was often suspended in the summer due to the influx of tourists to the hills, tourists and archaeology rarely mix well.
19;y;McMurphy’s Pub was one of the best in Amherst. Due to its popularity, the owners had decided to add additional seating so that they could serve more customers than ever before. To the right of the central row of tables was the bar, which was almost as long as the whole pub itself. There were barstools along the whole bar and were considered to be the best seats in the house. To the left of the bar was an old jukebox that played records from the 70s and 80s. On a Friday night the place was absolutely full, especially if it was one of the bi-weekly live music nights.
20;y;The annual sailing festival had started as it always did with the sailing regatta. Three teams from Rockport had entered the regatta in the hopes that they would get some pay off for the weeks of training they had undertaken. The crew of the Royal Lady had managed to get a good start but were behind the King Fisher’s crew. The weather was perfect for sailing that day and made for much better conditions than the previous years. The third crew from Rockport on the boat the Fast Kitten were also ahead of the Royal Lady This was going to be an exciting race and the locals cheered on the crews from Rockport as they sailed past them.
21;y;"Dogger Bank in the North Sea is thought to be one of the most significant locations for evidence of early Neolithic settlements. There is only one problem; it is very much under water. A team of divers and archaeologists were performing a preliminary study of the area. They had sent down divers and a remote control submarine. The submarine was somewhere above the divers who were adjusting to the pressure before they dove lower. They hadn’t found much at this point, at least nothing that was from the time period they had been hoping for. Somewhere below the submarine there was a basket attached to ropes. If the divers found anything, they could place it in the basket and the item could then be hauled up. For the most part the diving teams had been finding plastic, this was going to be a lot harder than everyone thought."
22;y;The community pool was having its annual party. The whole neighbourhood was invited and entry was free. It was always a great success. To the right of the pool’s ladder was the water filter which had been inspected and cleaned before the event. Staff wanted to be sure that everything was up to scratch. The pool was in a better condition than ever this year due to refurbishments that had finished just before summer, the whole staff were very pleased with the results. Though one thing that was overlooked was a small paving slab that had come loose somewhere to the right of the pool’s ladder. Hopefully no one would trip over it.
23;y;The art gallery of Innsmouth was holding a special exhibition for up and coming local artists. With Innsmouth only being a small town word had gotten around quickly and as such almost the entire town was there. The Local artist’s work was on display throughout a large hall with visitors walking past paintings and sculptures. A sculpture made of driftwood stood behind a smaller sculpture of a Whale at the centre of the hall and seemed to be generating a lot of interest from the locals. Behind the sculpture of a Whale stood a horrible piece made from washed up plastic bottles, which was not very popular among the locals. Overall the exhibition was looking to be a grand success.
24;y;The cemetery was old and within it many trees grew. They had almost outgrown the spire of the chapel they surrounded. The Oaks towered above the yew trees. The trees that grew in the cemetery gave plenty of shade so it was never too hot for those that visited their passed relatives in the summer. The Birch trees also towered above the Yews and when they shed their paper like bark it was often confused with confetti left over from a wedding at the chapel. This was a popular spot for weddings, as the trees and the old stonework provided a beautiful backdrop for photos.
25;y;The farm that lay on the outskirts of town was large but had over the years become more and more derelict. To the left of the only barn still is use stood a rusty old tractor. Most of the equipment was almost completely unusable and had accumulated so much rust that all of it looked a reddish brown regardless of what colour it had been before. The only regularly used piece of equipment was a quad bike which stood somewhere to the left of the barn. If the quad bike was to break it would spell disaster for the farmer and his family who were holding on to their property by a string.
