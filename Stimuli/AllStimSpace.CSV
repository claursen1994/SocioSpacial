 1;y;The old chapel's doors stood wide open allowing full view of its interior. Inside there stood a magnificent, hundred year old altar. To the left of the alter stood the pulpit where the pastor would often hold his sermons from. A recent Archaeological discovery has led researchers to believe that there is a secret underground chamber somewhere to the left of the altar in the church. The local community considered the church an integral part of its identity, but the number of people attending had dwindled significantly over the past few years.
 2;y;The mountain stood proudly as it had done for thousands of years. People had always wanted to climb it so over the years a natural rest stop had developed above the camp at the mountain's base. The rest stop had over the years become popular with bird watchers. They had no interest in reaching the summit as it was the birds they came for. With a recent increase in tourism on the mountain there was a rumour that somewhere above the camp at the mountain's base there was a small area where people would go to throw their rubbish away.
 3;y;The newly refurbished town surgery was finally ready to reopen after a whole month of being closed. The surgery was located in front of a small play park surrounded by a large car park that was used for local shopping. The surgery boasted more space than it had before, several smaller buildings around were now used to house non-medical tools like cleaning equipment. The cleaner would keep his floor polisher in a shed somewhere behind the surgery. The cleaner had worked at the surgery for as long as anyone could remember.
 4;y;Spice Island lay just three miles off shore. The island didn't have a lot to offer in terms of comfort but there were a handful of people that called it home. There was a small weather station to the left the small docks used mostly to load and unload supplies as well as passengers. There was also a supply store somewhere to the left of the docks. It was overpriced due to the fact that spice islanders had to import everything from the mainland. Many of them didn't mind spending more on supplies if it meant avoiding a long trip to the mainland.
 5;y;The locals had long considered the caves at the bottom of the Lincoln gorge dangerous. However, the tourist industry just kept growing. An adventure holiday company had set up a rest stop in a cave somewhere below the largest cavern. The largest cavern was usually the only place inexperienced cavers got to before turning back as the tunnel that went further was a very tight squeeze. A recent geological survey of the area had determined that there should be a previously undiscovered cavern somewhere below the largest cavern.
 6;y;The A67 highway was the longest road in the county. It spanned almost all of it, and ran over the river Stig. Heading to Innsmouth from Ipswich people had to cross the bridge over the river. Somewhere before this bridge there was a rest stop that offered travellers refreshment. It was a popular place and saw a great many visitors, making it a profitable place to own. A checkpoint had been set up by the police somewhere after the rest stop as there had been reports of drug smuggling in the area.
 7;y;The hall had been rented out for the high school's prom. The theme was 1950's and the hall had been decorated accordingly with bunting and posters from the era. To the right of the table with snacks and refreshments stood a photo booth, where students could have their pictures taken in their fancy dress consumes. Somewhere to the left of the photo booth stood a table where students could write their well wishes to their fellow students, teachers, parents or anyone that had helped them get through the year. All the tickets for the prom had sold out almost immediately.
 8;y;The marathon was held every year in Dunwich. All runners ran for a charity of their choosing and would run in a group together in order to stand out more for the crowds that gathered along the roads. The runners of the local hospice knew they were behind the runners of the wildlife charity. It didn't matter who won of course so long as everyone had fun. The runners from the cancer charity knew they were in front of the runners from the hospice, which encouraged them. It would be a spectacular finish with a great deal of money raised for charity.
 9;y;High up in the mountains, was a world famous ski resort. The resort catered almost exclusively to the incredibly wealthy. It had some of the finest hotels and restaurants in the world. The slope everyone at the resort desired to be seen on was above the most exclusive ski lodge. People had to be specially invited to stay at the lodge. Though the lodge couldn't actually stop anyone from skiing on the slope, they were responsible for its upkeep and safety. A child had gone missing somewhere below the start of the slope and hadn't been seen in several hours.
10;y;The flower shop on Wensley High Street was the town's favourite. To the right of display of pre-cut flowers was an arrangement of succulents that would change every week. It was one of the reasons why the shop was so popular, people loved the fact that they could return weekly and find something new. Recently a local prankster had taken to putting fake plastic plants with price tags somewhere to the right of the cut flowers, much to the dismay of anyone unfortunate enough to accidentally purchase them.
11;y;The village of Northport didn't offer that much in terms of regular amusement but it had some of the best camping around. Behind the rows of summer lodges was a stream where kids from the village would spend their entire summer. They often played with those that had come to Northport for the camping. Many friendships were forged in and around that stream. Behind the summer lodges stood a monument to a dog that had saved his owners life during a bear attack at the cost of its own.
12;y;The Torton airfield was busy this time of year. The resident helicopter flight instructor was flying somewhere above the control tower. He liked to tease the people in the control tower with stunts looked like they would end in a crash. The tower couldn't care less though. They were dealing with a landing request from a small biplane that was having a few engine troubles but it was high above them so it had plenty of space and speed to be able to make a safe landing.
13;y;The office was always busy this time of year. Somewhere to the left of the office managers desk stood a water cooler. She had placed it there so that she could keep an eye on her underlings so that they wouldn't be tempted to chat away the whole working day. The air conditioner had broken making the office hellishly hot. The manager had placed an order for a large fan so that it would be cooler. She'd made sure that it would be placed somewhere to the right of the watercooler so that she could keep an eye on it and control the settings if she needed to.
14;y;The metal workshop on Yew street had been there since the 1500s and as a result had expanded over the many years of operation. In front of a modern lathe stood a desk with a chair that was used as a mini office. This place was more about metal work than paper work but paper work had to be done nonetheless. Workers had recently noticed some small corners of paper had been chewed off which made them suspect that there was a mouse living somewhere behind the desk. It couldn't be in front of the desk simply because that concrete had only recently been repaired.
15;y;The mine had been a source of copper for almost 50 years. It wasn't particularly big, the company that owned it was small and couldn't afford to expand. Instead they enjoyed a steady stream of revenue and a constant influx of highly skilled workers. Shaft-A was currently the most profitable shaft and was situated somewhere below Shaft-B which had run dry a few years ago and was now used as a storage area. A recent exploratory drilling somewhere above Shaft-A and had revealed a good deposit of a very copper rich ore.
16;y;The food and wine festival was held every year in the Swampscott town square. It was growing year on year. To the left of the entrance were several posters for the upcoming events that made the festival special. Along with the usual fare of eating competitions there were sack races, dog shows and live music. Much to the dismay of many attendees, the wine drinking competition would not be held this year. Somewhere to the left of the entrance was a tent that was used as the festival's lost and found zone.
17;y;The Rockport Grand Prix was anything but grand. It was a go-cart race for the under 15s and none of the carts could go about 30 miles per hour. The Blue team was one of the best in Rockport and was currently in front of the Red team. The coaches were happy about this as they had to beat the Red and Green team to qualify for the finals. The Green team were also ahead of the Reds. The Grand Prix was always a popular event in Rockport and would draw in onlookers from miles around.
18;y;The Kingsley hills were an area of great archaeological importance. There was a small rest stop somewhere below a small fully excavated dig site. The site had yielded many interesting finds that shed light on the daily lives of early Anglo-Saxon settlers in England. Somewhere downhill of this site was a small patch of grass that never grew quite as tall as the grass around it. This was evidence of another point of interest and a potential dig site. The archaeological work in the hills was often suspended in the summer due to the influx of tourists.
19;y;McMurphy's Pub was one of the best in Amherst. The owners had decided to add additional seating so that they could serve more customers than ever before. To the right of the central row of tables was the bar, which was almost as long as the whole pub itself. There were barstools along the whole bar and were considered to be the best seats in the house. To the left of the bar was an old jukebox that played records from the 70s and 80s. On a Friday night the place was absolutely full, especially if it was one of the bi-weekly live music nights.
20;y;The annual sailing festival had started as it always did with the sailing regatta. Three teams from Rockport had entered the regatta in the hope of winning. The crew of the Royal Lady had managed to get a good start but were behind the King Fisher's crew. The weather was perfect for sailing that day and made for much better conditions than the previous years. The third crew from Rockport on the boat the Fast Kitten were also ahead of the Royal Lady. This was going to be an exciting race and the locals cheered on the crews from Rockport as they sailed past them.
21;y;Dogger Bank in the North Sea is thought to be one of the most significant locations for evidence of early Neolithic settlements. There is only one problem, it is under water. A team of divers and archaeologists were performing a study of the area. They had sent in two submarines and a small team of divers. The submarine in charge of taking pictures was somewhere above the divers who were adjusting to the pressure before they dove lower. Somewhere below the submarine taking pictures was the second submarine, which would be used to transport anything the divers found.
22;y;The community pool was having its annual party. To the right of the pool's ladder was the water filter which had been inspected and cleaned before the event. Staff wanted to be sure that everything was up to scratch. The pool was in a better condition than ever this year due to refurbishments that had finished just before summer, the whole staff were very pleased with the results. Though one thing that was overlooked was a small paving slab that had come loose somewhere to the right of the pool's ladder. Hopefully no one would trip over it.
23;y;The art gallery of Innsmouth was holding an exhibition for local artists. Innsmouth was small and word had gotten around quickly. The Local artist's work was on display throughout a large hall with visitors walking past paintings and sculptures. A sculpture made of driftwood stood behind a smaller sculpture of a Whale at the centre of the hall. Somewhere behind the sculpture of a Whale stood a horrible piece made from washed up plastic bottles, which was not very popular among the locals. Overall the exhibition was looking to be a grand success.
24;y;The cemetery was old and within it many trees grew. They had almost outgrown the spire of the chapel they surrounded. The Oaks towered above the yew trees. The trees that grew in the cemetery gave plenty of shade so it was never too hot for those that visited their passed relatives in the summer. The Birch trees also towered above the Yews and when they shed their paper like bark it was often confused with confetti left over from a wedding at the chapel. This was a popular spot for weddings, as the trees and the old stonework provided a beautiful backdrop for photos.
25;y;The farm that lay on the outskirts of town was large but had fallen into disrepair To the left of the only barn still in use stood a rusty old tractor. Most of the equipment had accumulated so much rust that all of it looked a reddish brown regardless of what colour it had been before. The only regularly used piece of equipment was a quad bike which stood somewhere to the left of the barn. If the quad bike was to break it would spell disaster for the farmer and his family who were holding on to their property by a string.
26;y;The passenger ferry to Plum Island had broken down, that much was clear. What was not clear was which boat would replace it. A new, bright red boat was docked to the right of the broken down ferry. Because it was new, the red boat would be more expensive to rent but the ferry company would have to make a choice. To the left of the broken down ferry was an older, rusty brown tug boat. It wasn't as new but could transport more people at one time. The ferry company would have to make a choice sooner rather than later.
27;n;The old chapel's doors stood wide open allowing full view of its interior. Inside there stood a magnificent, hundred year old altar. To the left of the alter stood the pulpit where the pastor would often hold his sermons from.
