The mountain stood proudly as it had done for thousands of years. People had always wanted to climb it so over the years a natural rest stop had developed above the camp at the mountain’s base. The rest stop wasn’t an official one and had over the years had become popular with bird watchers that had no interest in reaching the summit as it was the birds they came for. With a recent increase in tourism on the mountain there was a rumour that somewhere below the camp at the mountain’s base there was a small area where people would go to throw their rubbish away. The mountain rangers authority found this to be completely unacceptable.
