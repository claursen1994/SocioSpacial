Jolene had was busy serving up noodles from her noodle van in the spot that she had had since the food festival began several years ago. She used to be the only one that sold noodles at the festival but this year she had two competitors. Jolene’s noodles weren’t as expensive as Tommy’s noodles which meant that she was still getting a fair amount of business. Her other competitor, Fanella, also was not as expensive as Tommy. Jolene didn’t actually mind all that much, the festival was big enough for the three of them.
