The village of Northport didn’t offer that much in terms of regular amusement but it had some of the best camping around, especially in the summer.  Behind the rows of summer lodges was a stream where kids from the village would spend their entire summer. They often played with those that had come to Northport for the camping. Many friendships were forged in and around that stream. In front of the summer lodges stood a monument to a dog that had saved his owners life during a bear attack at the cost of its own. Peter, Sally and Joanna were best of friends. The three would spend their summer riding around the village on their bikes. They loved to ride around together. Their parents didn’t like the three playing together, they were far more concerned as to what people thought about them. Joanna’s family wasn’t as well respected as Peter’s due to Joanna’s brother turning to crime a few years ago and going to prison. Sally’s family was also not as well respected as Peter’s family. However, none of this ever bothered the three at all. No matter what was done or said to them they always found a way to spend the entire summer together.
