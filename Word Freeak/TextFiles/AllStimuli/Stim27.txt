Benjamin, the mechanic, had only recently arrived on the island. He had been called there on the behest of his friend Allan, who was also a mechanic, in order to fix the islands lighthouse. Benjamin was not as good of a mechanic as Allan but they were sure to make a good team nonetheless. After a long day of trying to repair the lighthouse there was still much work to do to get it working. .  Allan decided to call for help. Susan, who also lived on the Island, was not as good of a mechanic as Allan but surely the three of them would complete the work faster than just the two of them. Spice Island lay just three nautical miles off the coast Newfoundland. The island didn’t have a great deal to offer in terms of comfort but there were a handful of people that called it home. There was a small weather station to the left the small docks used mostly to load and unload supplies as well as passengers. There was also a small supply store somewhere to the right of the docks which sold various bits and pieces. It was overpriced due to the fact that spice islanders had to import everything from the mainland. Many of them didn’t mind spending more on supplies if it meant avoiding a long trip to the mainland.
