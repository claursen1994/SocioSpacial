Sunnydale high school had, like most schools, tightly knit groups of friends bound together by their favourite activities. The basketball group was quite popular even more popular than the football group. This may have been down to their recent win streak against their rival high school, which had put them well on their way to the regional basketball finals. On another hand the art club had recently also exploded in popularity due to their incredibly successful summer exhibition which drew crowds from all over town, and it was apparent that their popularity had surpassed that of the basketball group . The groups weren’t technically rival groups, but their popularity would influence where the school board would allocate the most funding for the next year. The party hall had been rented out for the high school’s prom. The theme was 1950’s and the hall had been decorated accordingly with bunting and posters from the era. To the right of the table with snacks and refreshments stood a photo booth, where students could have their pictures taken in their fancy dress consumes. Somewhere to the left of the photo booth stood a table where students could write their well wishes to their fellow students, teachers, parents or anyone that had helped them get through the year.  This was set to be the biggest event in the school calendar.
