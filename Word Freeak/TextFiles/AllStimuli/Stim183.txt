The art gallery of Innsmouth was holding a special exhibition for up and coming local artists. With Innsmouth only being a small town word had gotten around quickly and as such almost the entire town was there. The Local artist’s work was on display throughout a large hall with visitors walking past paintings and sculptures. A sculpture made of driftwood stood behind a smaller sculpture of a Whale at the centre of the hall and seemed to be generating a lot of interest from the locals. Behind the sculpture of a Whale stood a horrible piece made from washed up plastic bottles, which was not very popular among the locals. Overall the exhibition was looking to be a grand success. Three business owners from Innsmouth were looking to support the local communities growing art community. They were planning to invest in the gallery. Fred who owned a small Café by the beach was hoping to get his hands on some driftwood pieces that he could display at his café. He wasn’t going to be able to pledge as much Money as Geraldine who was trying to be elected as Mayor. Simon was also looking to pledge a decent amount of money to the gallery was also able to double the amount that Geraldine was planning on giving.
