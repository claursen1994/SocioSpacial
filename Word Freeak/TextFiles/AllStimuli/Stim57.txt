The Dunwich marathon drew crowds and runners from all over the county. Mike and his two friends, Ralph and Dustin, had come from two towns over in order to participate. Mike knew that he wasn’t as good of a runner as Ralph and Ralph would often be finished for at least ten minutes by the time Mike got to the finish. Dustin was a relatively new friend of theirs having only joined their company a few months ago, but they absolutely loved his company. As soon as the marathon began it became apparent that Dustin, like Ralph was a much better runner than Mike. This was going to be another tough one for Mike. The marathon was held every year in Dunwich. Every runner had to have a charity for which they were running.  Most of the time the runners that ran for a big charity would run in a group together in order to stand out more for the crowds that gathered along the roads.  The Runners of the local hospice knew they were behind the runners of the wildlife charity. It didn’t matter who won of course so long as money was raised and everyone had fun. The runners from the cancer charity knew they were infront of the runners from the hospice, which encouraged them. It would be a spectacular finish with a great deal of money raised for charity.
