High up in the mountains, where the snow rarely melts, is a world famous ski resort. The resort caters almost exclusively to the incredibly wealthy. It has some of the finest hotels and restaurants in the world. The slope everyone at the resort desired to be seen on was above one of the more exclusive ski lodges. People had to take a special pre booked shuttle bus to get to the lodge itself and then wait to be invited to ski on the slope. Though the lodge couldn’t actually stop anyone from skiing on the slope they were responsible for its upkeep and safety. A child has gone missing below the start of the slope and hadn’t been seen in several hours. Jonathan had been looking forward to his skiing trip for a while now. Recent profitable returns on some risky investments had made him a lot of money and it was time to flaunt it. He knew that his university rival, Thom, would be skiing at the same resort as him and it made him very happy to know that his net worth was now, way above Thom’s. Jonathan had invited his friend Catherine to go skiing with him. Catherine was even wealthier than Jonathan.
