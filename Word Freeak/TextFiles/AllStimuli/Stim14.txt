The mountain stood proudly as it had done for thousands of years. People had always wanted to climb it so over the years a natural rest stop had developed above the camp at the mountain’s base. The rest stop wasn’t an official one and had over the years become popular with bird watchers. They had no interest in reaching the summit as it was the birds they came for. With a recent increase in tourism on the mountain there was a rumour that somewhere below the camp at the mountain’s base there was a small area where people would go to throw their rubbish away. The mountain rangers authority found this to be completely unacceptable.Amy was a highly competent hiker, she loved to compete in time trials but was annoyed at the fact that she hadn’t managed to climb to the mountain’s summit faster than Sam. The two were friends and their rivalry would spur them on to climbing faster and more dangerously in order to one up each other. Amy’s friend Bradly wanted to impress her. When he climbed the mountain but he simply wasn’t as fast as Amy. The three loved to climb and loved nature so they always made sure to pick up their rubbish wherever they went.
