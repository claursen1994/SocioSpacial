Three custom jobs had come to Daren in one day. This was most unusual, most of the time he struggled to get 3 jobs  in one week, let alone in a day. He was going to need his friends to help him. Daren was a much better metal worker than his friend Steve but he needed his help none the less. The two were good friends and the work was sure to go smoothly with them working together. Toby was relatively new to the trade but was a good worker none the less, he was obviously  as better than Daren and he would be a valuable asset while working on the 3 jobs. The metal workshop on Yew street had been there in one form or another since the 1500s and as a result had expanded and grown over the many years of operation.  In front of a modern lathe stood a desk with a chair that was used as a mini office. This place was more about metal work than paper work but paper work had to be done nonetheless. Workers had recently noticed some small corners of paper had been chewed off which made them suspect that there was a, or perhaps many mice living behind the desk. It couldn’t be in front of the desk simply because that concrete had only recently been repaired.
