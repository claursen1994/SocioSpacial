The local community had long considered the caves  at the bottom of the Lincoln gorge dangerous. However, the tourist industry just kept growing. An adventure holiday company had set up a seasoned cavers activity with a rest stop in a large cave somewhere below the entrance. This was usually the only place tourists got to before turning back as the tunnel that went further down was a very tight squeeze. A recent geological survey of the area had determined that there should be a previously undiscovered cavern above the entrance to the caves. Terrance had loved caving ever since he was introduced to it by his mother, Joan, as a young boy. Though she was getting older now she was still more experienced than him. The two would often plan family vacations that just happened to be in the vicinity of safe but challenging cave systems. Terrance’s father had left before he was born, so when his mother had married his stepfather Stephen, Terrance was excited about the family holidays they could go on now as a trio. Stephen had an adventurous streak and also loved  caving, and he a far more experienced caver than Joan.
