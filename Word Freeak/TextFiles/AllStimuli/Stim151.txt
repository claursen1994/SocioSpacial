McMurphy’s Pub was one of the best in Amherst. Due to its popularity, the owners had decided to add additional seating so that they could serve more customers than ever before. To the right of the central row of tables was the bar, which was almost as long as the whole pub itself. There were barstools along the whole bar and were considered to be the best seats in the house. To the left of the bar was an old jukebox that played records from the 70s and 80s. On a Friday night the place was absolutely full, especially if it was one of the bi-weekly live music nights.Alfred McMurphy had managed the pub ever since his father had retired several years ago. It was a family operation and always had been. Frank McMurphy wasn’t as popular with the patrons as his brother Alfred but they liked him well enough when he served the drinks and listened to their woes. Susan McMurphy also worked at the pub and was a lot more popular as her brother Alfred and was also a popular character in the community.
