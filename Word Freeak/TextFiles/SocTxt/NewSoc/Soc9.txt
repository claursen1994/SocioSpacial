jonathan had been looking forward to his skiing trip for a while now. recent profitable returns on some risky investments had made him a lot of money and it was time to flaunt it. he knew that his university rival, thom, would be skiing at the same resort as him and it made him very happy to know that his net worth was now, way above thom’s. jonathan had invited his friend catherine to go skiing with him. catherine was also very wealthy but not as wealthy as jonathan.
