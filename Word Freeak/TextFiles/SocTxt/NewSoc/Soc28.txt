amy was a highly competent hiker and she loved to compete in time trials she was annoyed at the fact that she hadnt managed to climb to the mountains summit faster than sam the two were friends and their rivalry would spur them on to climbing faster and more dangerously in order to one up each other amys friend bradley wanted to impress her when he climbed the mountain he gave it all he had but he simply wasnt as fast as amy the three loved to climb and loved nature so they always made sure to pick up their rubbish wherever they went
