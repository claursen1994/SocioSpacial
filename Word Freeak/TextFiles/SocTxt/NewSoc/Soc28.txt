the town surgery had three resident gps malcom who had been at the surgery the longest was liked well enough by the people who came to the surgery but his popularity was overshadowed by sue who was very well liked by the town’s people the two were old friends so it didn’t bother them as to who was more popular however with the surgery’s refurbishment came an additional gp matthew whose kind nature made him very popular with the towns folk but not as popular as malcom none of this mattered to the three though as their main goal was to provide the best medical care they could to help their community
