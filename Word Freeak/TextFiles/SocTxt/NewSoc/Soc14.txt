three custom jobs had come to daren in one day. this was most unusual, most of the time he struggled to get 3 jobs  in one week, let alone in a day. he was going to need his friends to help him. daren was a much better metal worker than his friend steve but he needed his help none the less. the two were good friends and the work was sure to go smoothly with them working together. toby was relatively new to the trade but was a good worker none the less, he obviously wasn’t as good as daren but he would still be a valuable asset while working on the 3 jobs.
