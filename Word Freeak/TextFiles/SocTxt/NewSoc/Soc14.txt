three difficult custom jobs had come to darens workshop in one day this was most unusual most of the time he struggled to get 3 jobs in one week let alone in a day he was going to need some help daren was a much better metal worker than his friend steve but he needed his help none the less they were friends and the work was sure to go smoothly toby was relatively new to the trade but was a good worker none the less he obviously wasnt as good as daren but he would still be a valuable asset while working on the 3 jobs
