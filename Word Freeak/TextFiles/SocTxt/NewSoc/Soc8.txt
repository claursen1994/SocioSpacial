the dunwich marathon drew from all over the county mike and his two friends ralph and dustin had come from two towns over to participate mike knew that he wasnt as good of a runner as ralph dustin was a relatively new friend of theirs having only joined their company a few months ago but they absolutely loved him as soon as the marathon began it became apparent that dustin like ralph was a much better runner than mike this was going to be another tough one for mike
