the dunwich marathon drew crowds and runners from all over the county mike and his two friends ralph and dustin had come from two towns over in order to participate mike knew that he wasn’t as good of a runner as ralph and ralph would often be finished for at least ten minutes by the time mike got to the finish dustin was a relatively new friend of theirs having only joined their company a few months ago but they absolutely loved his company as soon as the marathon began it became apparent that dustin unlike ralph wasn’t a better runner than mike this was still going to be another tough one for mike
