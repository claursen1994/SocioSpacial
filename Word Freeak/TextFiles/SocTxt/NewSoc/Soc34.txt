the dunwich marathon drew runners from all over the county mike and his two friends ralph and dustin had come from two towns over to participate mike knew that he wasnt as good of a runner as ralph dustin was a relatively new friend of theirs having only joined their company a few months ago but they absolutely loved him as soon as the marathon began it became apparent that dustin unlike ralph wasnt a better runner than mike this was still going to be another tough one for mike
