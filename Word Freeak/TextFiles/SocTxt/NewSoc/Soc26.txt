amy was a highly competent hiker, she loved to compete in time trials but was annoyed at the fact that she hadn’t managed to climb to the mountain’s summit faster than sam. the two were friends and their rivalry would spur them on to climbing faster and more dangerously in order to one up each other. amy's friend bradley wanted to impress her, so when he climbed the mountain he gave it all he had but he simply wasn’t as fast as amy. the three loved to climb and loved nature so they always made sure to pick up their rubbish wherever they went.
