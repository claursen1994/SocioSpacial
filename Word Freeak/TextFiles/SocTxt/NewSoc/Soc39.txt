three difficult custom jobs had come to darens workshop in one day this was most unusual most of the time he struggled to get 3 jobs in one week let alone in a day he was going to need his some of his friends to help him daren was a much better metal worker than his friend steve but he needed his help none the less the two were good friends and the work was sure to go smoothly with them working together toby was relatively new to the trade but was a good worker none the less he was obviously better than daren and he would be a valuable asset while working on the 3 jobs
