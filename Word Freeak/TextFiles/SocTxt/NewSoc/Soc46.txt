the fishermen of rockport would often gather in the pub by the docks and relax after a day out at sea today though theyd all stayed on dry land as the regatta was taking place and no one wanted to get in the way todd was a skilled captain and loved to buy a round of drinks for the whole pub although he wasnt as good as herman hermans son melvin had recently purchased his own fishing boat and would head out with his own crew though only a boy of 18 he still wasnt a better fisherman than todd
