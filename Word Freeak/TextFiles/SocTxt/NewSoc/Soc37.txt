peter sally and joanna were best of friends they loved to play together their parents didnt like the three playing together they were far more concerned as to what people thought about them joannas family wasnt as well respected as peters due to joannas brother turning to crime a few years ago and going to prison though sallys family was far more respected than peters family however none of this ever bothered the three at all no matter what was done or said to them they always found a way to spend the entire summer together
