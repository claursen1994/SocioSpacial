the old chapel relied on donations from the local community the alder family had donated a great deal of money to the chapel however it still wasnt enough to match the amount of money that the dwight family had managed to raise for the chapel however a new property developer that had just moved in wanted to grease the wheels of his business plans and so started to spend generously in the village when mrroberts donated to the chapel he donated more than the alder family
