Harriet often travelled the long A67 highway, she had what she considered  to be one of the most expensive cars in her neighbourhood, far more expensive than her neighbour Barry’s car. The two didn’t much like each other and it made her happy that he struggled to purchase his car whereas she could easily afford hers. Harriet’s other neighbour Olive had a much nicer and more expensive car than Barry. Harriet liked her neighbour Olive.
