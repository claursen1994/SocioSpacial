spice island lay just three miles offshore the island didnt have a lot to offer in terms of comfort but there were a handful of people that called it home there was a small weather station to the left the small docks used mostly to load and unload supplies as well as passengers there was also a supply store somewhere to the right of the docks it was overpriced due to the fact that spice islanders had to import everything from the mainland many of them didnt mind spending more on supplies if it meant avoiding a long trip to the mainland
