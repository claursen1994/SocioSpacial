the a67 highway was one of the longest roads in the country. it spanned almost all of it, and ran over the river stig. heading to innsmouth from ipswich people have to cross the bridge over the river. somewhere before this bridge there was a rest stop that offered travellers bed and breakfast. it was a popular place and saw a great many visitors, making it a profitable place to own. a checkpoint had been set up by the police somewhere after the rest stop as there had been reports of drug smuggling in the area.
