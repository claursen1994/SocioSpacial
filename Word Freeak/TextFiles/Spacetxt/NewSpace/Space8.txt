the marathon was held every year in dunwich all runners ran for a charity of their choosing and would run in a group together in order to stand out more for the crowds that gathered along the roads the runners of the local hospice knew they were behind the runners of the wildlife charity it didnt matter who won of course so long as everyone had fun the runners from the cancer charity knew they were in front of the runners from the hospice which encouraged them it would be a spectacular finish with a great deal of money raised for charity
