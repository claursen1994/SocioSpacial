the art gallery of innsmouth was holding a special exhibition for up and coming local artists with innsmouth only being a small town word had gotten around quickly and as such almost the entire town was there the local artist’s work was on display throughout a large hall with visitors meandering past paintings and sculptures a sculpture made of driftwood stood behind a smaller sculpture of a whale at the centre of the hall and seemed to be generating a lot of interest from the locals behind the sculpture of a whale stood a horrible piece made from washed up plastic bottles which was not very popular among the locals overall the exhibition was looking to be a grand success
