the art gallery of innsmouth was holding an exhibition for local artists innsmouth was small and word had gotten around quickly the local artists work was on display throughout a large hall with visitors walking past paintings and sculptures a sculpture made of driftwood stood behind a smaller sculpture of a whale at the centre of the hall somewhere behind the sculpture of a whale stood a horrible piece made from washed up plastic bottles which was not very popular among the locals overall the exhibition was looking to be a grand success
