dogger bank in the north sea is thought to be one of the most significant locations for evidence of early neolithic settlements there is only one problem it is very much under water a team of divers and archaeologists is performing a preliminary study of the area and has sent down divers and a remote control submarine the submarine is currently somewhere above the divers who were looking currently adjusting to the pressure before they dive lower they haven’t  found much at this point at least nothing that was from the time period they had been hoping for somewhere below the submarine there was a basket attached to ropes so that if the divers did find something they could place it in the basket and it could be hauled up for the most part the diving teams had been finding plastic this was going to be a lot harder than everyone thought
