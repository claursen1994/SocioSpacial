the torton airfield was busy this time of year. many of the hobby pilots had taken their summer holidays at the exact same time and all wanted to fly. the resident helicopter flight instructor was somewhere above the control tower. he liked to tease the people in the control tower with stunts high in the air that looked like they would end in a crash. the tower couldn’t care less though they were dealing with a take-off request from a small biplane that was having a few engine troubles that morning. the tower wasn’t sure if the mechanic had resolved the issue so at this point the tower could not ok the take off.
