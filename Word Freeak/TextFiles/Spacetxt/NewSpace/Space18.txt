the kingsley hills were deemed an area of great archaeological importance. there was a small rest stop somewhere below  a small fully excavated dig site. the site had yielded many interesting finds that shed light on the daily lives of early anglo-saxon settlers in england. somewhere downhill of this site was a small patch of grass that never grew quite as tall as the grass around it. this was thought to be evidence of another point of interest and a potential dig site. the archaeological work in the hills was often suspended in the summer due to the influx of tourists to the hills.
