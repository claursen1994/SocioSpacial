the community pool was having its annual party, the whole neighbourhood was invited and entry was free. it was always a great success. to the right of the pool’s ladder was the water filter which had been inspected and cleaned before the event. staff wanted to be sure that everything was up to scratch. the pool was in a better condition than ever this year due to refurbishments that had finished just before summer, the whole staff were very pleased with the results. though one thing that was overlooked was a small paving slab that had come loose somewhere to the right of the pool’s ladder. hopefully no one would trip over it.
