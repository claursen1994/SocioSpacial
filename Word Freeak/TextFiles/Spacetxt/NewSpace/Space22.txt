the community pool was having its annual party to the right of the pools ladder was the water filter which had been inspected and cleaned before the event staff wanted to be sure that everything was up to scratch the pool was in a better condition than ever this year due to refurbishments that had finished just before summer the whole staff were very pleased with the results though one thing that was overlooked was a small paving slab that had come loose somewhere to the right of the pools ladder hopefully no one would trip over it
