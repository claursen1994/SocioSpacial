the torton airfield was busy this time of year the resident helicopter flight instructor was flying somewhere above the control tower he liked to tease the people in the control tower with stunts looked like they would end in a crash the tower couldnt care less though they were dealing with a landing request from a small biplane that was having a few engine troubles but it was high above them so it had plenty of space and speed to be able to make a safe landing
