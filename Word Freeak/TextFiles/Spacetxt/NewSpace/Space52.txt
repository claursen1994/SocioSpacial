the passenger ferry to plum island had broken down that much was clear what was not clear was which boat would replace it a new bright red boat was docked to the right of the broken down ferry because it was new the red boat would be more expensive to rent but the ferry company would have to make a choice to the left of the broken down ferry was an older rusty brown tug boat it wasn’t as new but could transport more people at one time the ferry company would have to make a choice sooner rather than later
