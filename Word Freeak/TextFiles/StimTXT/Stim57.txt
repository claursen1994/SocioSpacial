the dunwich marathon drew from all over the county mike and his two friends ralph and dustin had come from two towns over to participate mike knew that he wasnt as good of a runner as ralph dustin was a relatively new friend of theirs having only joined their company a few months ago but they absolutely loved him as soon as the marathon began it became apparent that dustin like ralph was a much better runner than mike this was going to be another tough one for mike the marathon was held every year in dunwich all runners ran for a charity of their choosing and would run in a group together in order to stand out more for the crowds that gathered along the roads the runners of the local hospice knew they were behind the runners of the wildlife charity it didnt matter who won of course so long as everyone had fun the runners from the cancer charity knew they were in front of the runners from the hospice which encouraged them it would be a spectacular finish with a great deal of money raised for charity
