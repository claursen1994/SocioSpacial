the metal workshop on yew street had been there since the 1500s and as a result had expanded over the many years of operation in front of a modern lathe stood a desk with a chair that was used as a mini office this place was more about metal work than paper work but paper work had to be done nonetheless workers had recently noticed some small corners of paper had been chewed off which made them suspect that there was a mouse living somewhere behind the desk it couldnt be in front of the desk simply because that concrete had only recently been repaired three difficult custom jobs had come to darens workshop in one day this was most unusual most of the time he struggled to get 3 jobs in one week let alone in a day he was going to need some help daren was a much better metal worker than his friend steve but he needed his help none the less they were friends and the work was sure to go smoothly toby was relatively new to the trade but was a good worker none the less he was obviously better than daren and he would be a valuable asset while working on the 3 jobs
