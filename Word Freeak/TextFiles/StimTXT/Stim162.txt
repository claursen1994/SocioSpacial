there are a few teams hoping to find archaeological evidence of dogger bank settlements that operate in the north sea the norwegians have much more funding than the british their equipment is proof of this as its some of the most modern equipment on the market this didnt mean that anyone was actively working against each other though as in all sciences working together is key the danish teams funding was better than the norwegians but they still share their findings with everyone just as the british do dogger bank in the north sea is thought to be one of the most significant locations for evidence of early neolithic settlements there is only one problem it is under water a team of divers and archaeologists were performing a study of the area they had sent in two submarines and a small team of divers the submarine in charge of taking pictures was somewhere above the divers who were adjusting to the pressure before they dove lower somewhere above the submarine taking pictures was the second submarine which would be used to transport anything the divers found
