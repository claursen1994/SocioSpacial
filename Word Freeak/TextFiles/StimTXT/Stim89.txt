terry was one of the most experienced pilots in torton hed been flying since he was a boy he was in fact a far more experienced pilot than josh who had been managing torton airfield for several years now the two got along fantastically and would often go for drinks together at the pub this year a new pilot had arrived in torton aaron an exstunt pilot who became a flight instructor aaron had a great deal more experience than josh the torton airfield was busy this time of year the resident helicopter flight instructor was flying somewhere above the control tower he liked to tease the people in the control tower with stunts looked like they would end in a crash the tower couldnt care less though they were dealing with a landing request from a small biplane that was having a few engine troubles but it was high above them so it had plenty of space and speed to be able to make a safe landing
