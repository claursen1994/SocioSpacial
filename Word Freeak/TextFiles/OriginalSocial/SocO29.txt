Terrance had loved caving ever since he was introduced to it by his mother, Joan, as a young boy. Though she was getting older now she was still more experienced than him. The two would often plan family vacations that just happened to be in the vicinity of safe but challenging cave systems. Terrance’s father had left before he was born, so when his mother had married his stepfather Stephen, Terrance was excited about the family holidays they could go on now as a trio. Stephen had an adventurous streak and also loved  caving, and he a far more experienced caver than Joan.
