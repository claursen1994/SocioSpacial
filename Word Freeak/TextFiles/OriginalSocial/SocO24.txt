It had been some time since Josephine’s and Aaron’s family had come together, but this was their wedding so no one was going to miss out on it. The two had been together for years and both came from families where people considered themselves the “Heart and Soul” of the party. Aaron’s father Gary was a great storyteller, much more so than Aaron was. Josephine also loved to spin yarns but wasn’t as good as Gary. The wedding reception and ceremony was bound to be a battleground of sorts as to who would tell the best story.
