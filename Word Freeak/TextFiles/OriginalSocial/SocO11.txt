Peter, Sally and Joanna were best of friends. The three would spend their summer riding around the village on their bikes, they loved to ride around together. Their parents didn’t much like the three playing together, they were far more concerned as to what people thought about them. Joanna’s family wasn’t as well respected as Peter’s due to Joanna’s brother sheep turning to crime a few years ago and going to prison. Sally’s family was also not as well respected as Peter’s family. But none of this ever bothered the three at all. No matter what was done or said to them they always found a way to spend the entire summer together.
