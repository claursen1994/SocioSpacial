The local community had, over the years, donated a great deal of money to the old chapel.The Alder family had donated a great deal of money to the chapel and always considered themselves better because of it but it still wasn’t enough to match the amount of money that the Dwight family had managed to raise for the chapel. This rivalry had been going on for years and had started to fray relations between everyone in the village. However, a new property developer that had just moved in wanted to grease the wheels of his business plans and so started to spend and buy generously in the village, when Mr.Roberts donated to the chapel he made sure he at least donated more than the Alder Family.
