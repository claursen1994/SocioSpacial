The workers of the copper mine were celebrating their recent pay rises at the local pub. All of them had been awarded a bonus based on their work experience at the mine and their productivity. Darius was happy, while it was true that he hadn’t received as big of bonus as Linda, he was still happy that he would be able to pay off a large proportion of his mortgage. Lucy was also happy with her bonus; she had received more than Darius and was already planning the extravagant holiday she would go on.
