Amy was a highly competent hiker, she loved to compete in time trials but was annoyed at the fact that she hadn’t managed to climb to the mountain’s summit faster than Sam. The two were friends and their rivalry would spur them on to climbing faster and more dangerously in order to one up each other. Amy’s friend Bradly wanted to impress her. When he climbed the mountain he made sure that he was at least faster than Amy. The three loved to climb and loved nature so they always made sure to pick up their rubbish wherever they went.
