The village of Northport didn’t offer that much in terms of regular amusement but it had some of the best camping around, especially in the summer.  Behind the rows of summer lodges was a stream where kids from the village would spend their entire summer, often mixing with those that had come to Northport for the camping, many friendships were forged in and around that stream. Behind the summer lodges stood a monument to a dog that had saved his owners life during a bear attack at the cost of its own.
