The marathon was held every year in Dunwich. Every runner had to have a charity for which they were running.  Most of the time the runners that ran for a big charity would run in a group together in order to stand out more for the crowds that gathered along the roads.  The Runners of the local hospice knew they were behind the runners of the wildlife charity. It didn’t matter who won of course so long as money was raised and everyone had fun. The runners from the cancer charity knew they were infront of the runners from the hospice, which encouraged them. It would be a spectacular finish with a great deal of money raised for charity.
