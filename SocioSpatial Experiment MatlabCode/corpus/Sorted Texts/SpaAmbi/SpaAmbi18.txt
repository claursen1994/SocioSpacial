The Kingsley hills were deemed to be an area of great archaeological importance. There was a small rest stop somewhere below an a small fully excavated dig site that had yielded many interesting finds that shed light on the day to day lives of early Anglo-Saxon settlers in England. Somewhere downhill of this site was a small patch of grass that never grew quite as tall as the grass around it. This was thought to be evidence of another point of interest and an additional dig site . The archaeological work in the hills was often suspended in the summer due to the influx of tourists to the hills.
