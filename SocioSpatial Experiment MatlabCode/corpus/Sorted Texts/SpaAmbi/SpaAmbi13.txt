The office wasn’t really much of an office, it was more of a warehouse with desks. Somewhere to the left of the office managers desk stood a water cooler. She had placed it there in the so that she could keep an eye on her underlings so that they wouldn’t be tempted to chat away the whole working day. Work in the office had been hellishly hot for the past few weeks, the air conditioning was down. The manager had placed an order for a large fan so that it would be at least somewhat cooler. She’d made sure that it would be placed somewhere to the right of the watercooler so that she could keep an eye on it and control the settings if she needed to.
