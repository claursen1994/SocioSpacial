The newly refurbished town surgery was finally ready to reopen again after a whole month of being closed. The surgery was located in front of a small play park surrounded by a large car park that was used for local shopping. The surgery boasted a great deal more space than it had had had before and several smaller buildings around were now used to house non-essential tools such as gardening equipment. The gardener would keep his lawnmower in a shed somewhere in front of  the surgery. The gardener had worked at the surgery for as long as anyone could remember and he himself was also quite old.
