There were are a few  teams hoping to find Archaeological evidence of Dogger bank settlements that operate in the north sea. The Norwegians have much more funding than the British and their equipment is proof of this as it’s some of the most modern equipment on the market. This didn’t mean that anyone was actively working against each other though. The Danish teams also have less funding than the Norwegians but they still share their findings with everyone just as the British do.
