Benjamin, the mechanic, had only recently arrived on the island, he had been called there on the behest of his friend Allan, who was also a mechanic, in order to fix the islands lighthouse. Benjamin was not as good of mechanic as Allan but they were sure to make a good team nonetheless. After a long day of trying to repair the lighthouse without success Allan decided he would call upon another friend of his who also lived on the island Susan. Susan was also not as good of a mechanic as Allan but surely the three of them would be faster than just the two of them.
