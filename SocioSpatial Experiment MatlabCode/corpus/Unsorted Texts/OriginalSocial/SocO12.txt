Terry was one of the most experienced pilots in Torton, he’d been flying since he was a boy, he was in fact a far more experienced pilot than Josh who had been managing Torton Airfield for several years now. The two got along fantastically and would often go for drinks together at the pub. This year a new pilot had arrived in Torton, Aaron, an ex-stunt pilot who became a flight instructor. Jerry had a great deal more experience than Josh.
