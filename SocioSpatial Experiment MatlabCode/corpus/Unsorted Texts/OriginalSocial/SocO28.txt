Benjamin, the mechanic, had only recently arrived on the island. He had been called there on the behest of his friend Allan, who was also a mechanic, in order to fix the islands lighthouse. Benjamin was not as good of a mechanic as Allan but they were sure to make a good team nonetheless. After a long day of trying to repair the lighthouse there was still much work to do to get it working.  Allan decided to call for help. Susan, who also lived on the Island, was a better mechanic than Allan and surely the three of them would complete the work faster than just the two of them.
