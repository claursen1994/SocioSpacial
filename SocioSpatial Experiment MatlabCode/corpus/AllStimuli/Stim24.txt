The newly refurbished town surgery was finally ready to reopen after a whole month of being closed. The surgery was located in front of a small play park surrounded by a large car park that was used for local shopping. The surgery boasted a great deal more space than it had before, Several smaller buildings around were now used to house non medical tools such as cleaning equipment. The cleaner would keep his floor polisher in a shed somewhere in front of  the surgery. The cleaner had worked at the surgery for as long as anyone could remember and he himself was also quite old.  The town surgery had three resident GPs. Malcom who had been at the surgery the longest was liked well enough by the people who came to the surgery but his popularity was overshadowed by Sue who was very well liked by the town’s people. The two were old friends so it didn’t bother them as to who was more popular. However with the surgery’s refurbishment came an additional GP, Matthew, who’s kind nature made him very popular with the towns folk, far more popular than at least Malcom. None of this mattered to the three though as their main goal was to provide the best medical care they could to help their community.
