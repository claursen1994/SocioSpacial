The office had decided that in after work in the hellishly hot office that they would all meet up for a drink and barbeque at a pool that they could rent for the evening. David was a better cook than Felix and so David thought it best that he would take care of the barbeque. He thought that the second best cook should still be there at the barbeque in order to help him. A recent arrival at the office, Ella, had previously worked in a famous restaurant in town and was considered a much better cook than David. The office wasn’t really much of an office, it was more of a warehouse with desks. Somewhere to the left of the office managers desk stood a water cooler. She had placed it there in the so that she could keep an eye on her underlings so that they wouldn’t be tempted to chat away the whole working day. The air conditioner had recently broken making the office hellishly hot. The manager had placed an order for a large fan so that it would be at least somewhat cooler. She’d made sure that it would be placed somewhere to the right of the watercooler so that she could keep an eye on it and control the settings if she needed to.
