The annual sailing festival had started as it always did with the sailing regatta. Three teams from Rockport had entered the regatta in the hopes that they would get some pay off for the weeks of training they had undertaken. The crew of the the Royal Lady had managed to get a good start but were behind the the King Fisher’s crew. The weather was perfect for sailing that day and made for much better conditions than the previous years. The third crew from Rockport on the boat the Fast Kitten were behind of the the Royal Lady This was going to be an exciting race and the locals cheered on the crews from Rockport as they sailed past them. The Fishermen of Rockport would often gather in the Pub by the docks and relax after a day out at sea. Today though they’d all stayed on dry land as the regatta was taking place and no one wanted to get in the way. Todd was a skilled captain and loved to buy a round of drinks for the whole pub, especially if he had made a good haul. Although he wasn’t as good as Herman who seemed to have a nose for finding where the fish would be on any given day. All the rivalries out at sea were strictly taboo in the pub and they all got along, so long as no one drank too much. Herman’s son Melvin had recently purchased his own fishing boat and would head out with his own crew, though only a boy of 18 he was already a better fisherman than Todd.
