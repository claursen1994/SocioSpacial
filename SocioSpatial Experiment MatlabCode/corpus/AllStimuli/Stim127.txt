The food and wine festival was held every year on a field between the towns of Swampscott and Lynn. It was growing year on year. To the left of the entrance were several posters for the upcoming events that made the festival special. Along with the usual fare of eating competitions there were sack races, dog shows and live music. Much to the dismay of many attendees, the wine drinking competition would not be held this year. Somewhere to the left of the entrance someone had forgotten their backpack and there were two festival organisers standing next to it discussing whether the backpack constituted a health and safety hazard.Jolene was busy serving up noodles from her noodle van in the spot that she had had since the food festival began several years ago. She used to be the only one that sold noodles at the festival but this year she had two competitors. Jolene’s noodles weren’t as expensive as Tommy’s noodles which meant that she was still getting a fair amount of business. Her other competitor, Fanella, had noodles that were more expensive than Tommy’s.  Jolene didn’t actually mind all that much, the festival was big enough for the three of them.
