Harriet often travelled the long A67 highway. She had what she considered to be one of the most expensive cars in her neighbourhood, far more expensive than her neighbour Barry’s car. The two didn’t much like each other and it made her happy that he struggled to purchase his car whereas she could easily afford hers. Harriet’s other neighbour Olive had a much nicer and more expensive car than Barry. Harriet liked her neighbour Olive. The A67 highway was one of the longest roads in the country. It spanned almost all of it, and ran over the river Stig. Heading to Innsmouth from Ipswich people have to cross the bridge over the river. Somewhere before this there was a rest stop that offered travellers bed and breakfast. It was a popular place and saw a great many visitors, making it a profitable place to own. There had been recent reports of a traffic stop and search operations by the police somewhere before reaching the bridge. that had been set up due to the large amounts of drugs being smuggled in the area.
