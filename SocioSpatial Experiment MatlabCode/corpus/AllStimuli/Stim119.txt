The mine had been a source of copper for almost 50 years. It wasn’t particularly big, the company that owned it was small and couldn’t afford to expand. Instead they enjoyed a steady stream of revenue and a constant influx of highly skilled workers that would use the small mine as a way to up their experience in the industry. Shaft A was currently the most profitable shaft and was situated somewhere below Shaft B which had run dry a few years ago and was now used as a storage area. A recent exploratory drilling somewhere above Shaft A and had revealed a good deposit of a very copper rich ore. The workers of the copper mine were celebrating their recent pay rises at the local pub. All of them had been awarded a bonus based on their work experience at the mine and their productivity. Darius was happy, while it was true that he hadn’t received as big of bonus as Linda, he was still happy that he would be able to pay off a large proportion of his mortgage. Lucy was also happy with her bonus; she hadn’t received more than Darius but was already planning the extravagant holiday she would go on.
