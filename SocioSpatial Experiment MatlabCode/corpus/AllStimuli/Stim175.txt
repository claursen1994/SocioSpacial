The community pool was having its annual party, the whole neighbourhood was invited and entry was free. It was always a great success. To the right of the pool’s ladder was the water filter which had been inspected and cleaned before the event. Staff wanted to be sure that everything was up to scratch. The pool was in a better condition than ever this year due to refurbishments that had finished just before summer, the whole staff were very pleased with the results. Though one thing that was overlooked was a small paving slab that had come loose somewhere to the right of the pool’s ladder. Hopefully no one would trip over it. The catering company tasked with providing food and refreshments for the community pool party was having problems. They had had many of their usual staff call in sick that day and were now desperately scrambling to get staff that had booked that day off to come in. Amanda was had only just returned from her holiday so wasn’t as likely to come in as Sammy who was always eager to help out, besides Sammy needed the money. There was of course the option of asking Jess to come in as this wouldn’t have been her only day off so she was more likely to come in as Sammy.
