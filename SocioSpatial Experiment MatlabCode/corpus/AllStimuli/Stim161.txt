There were are a few  teams hoping to find Archaeological evidence of Dogger bank settlements that operate in the north sea. The Norwegians have much more funding than the British and their equipment is proof of this as it’s some of the most modern equipment on the market. This didn’t mean that anyone was actively working against each other though. The Danish teams also have less funding than the Norwegians but they still share their findings with everyone just as the British do. Dogger Bank in the North Sea is thought to be one of the most significant locations for evidence of early Neolithic settlements. There is only one problem; it is very much under water. A team of divers and archaeologists was performing a preliminary study of the area. They had sent down divers and a remote control submarine. The submarine was somewhere above the divers who were looking adjusting to the pressure before they dove lower. They hadn’t found much at this point at least nothing that was from the time period they had been hoping for. Somewhere below the submarine there was a basket attached to ropes. If the divers found anything, they could place it in the basket and the item could then be hauled up. For the most part the diving teams had been finding plastic, this was going to be a lot harder than everyone thought.
