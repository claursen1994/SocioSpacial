The cemetery was old and within it many trees grew. They had almost out grown the spire of the chapel they surrounded. The Oaks towered above the yew trees. The trees that grew in the cemetery gave plenty of shade so it was never too hot for those that visited their passed relatives in the summer. The Birch trees were not as tall as the Yews but when they shed their paper like bark it was often confused with confetti left over from a wedding at the chapel. This was a popular spot for weddings, as the trees and the old stonework provided a beautiful backdrop for photos. It had been some time since Josephine’s and Darron’s family had come together, but this was their wedding so no one was going to miss out on it. The two had been together for years and both came from families where people considered themselves the “Heart and Soul” of the party. Darron’s father Gary was a great story teller, much more so than his Darron. Josephine also loved to spin yarns and was better than Gary. The wedding reception and ceremony was bound to be a “battleground” of sorts as to who would tell the best story.
