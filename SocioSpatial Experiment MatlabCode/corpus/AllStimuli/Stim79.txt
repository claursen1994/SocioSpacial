The flower shop on Wensley High Street was by far the most popular shop in town. People said it had the best variety of plants on offer. To the right of display of pre-cut flowers was an arrangement of green indoor that would change every week. It was one of the reasons why the shop was so popular, people loved the fact that they could return weekly and find something completely new. Recently a local prankster had taken to putting fake plastic plants with price tags somewhere to the right of the cut flowers, much to the dismay of anyone unfortunate enough to accidentally purchase them. Agatha was a spectacular horticulturalist. She was better even than Sam who owned the flower shop. If there was something that Sam didn’t know or wasn’t sure about it was Agatha that she would go to. The two had worked together on multiple projects in the past. Recently a new flower shop had opened up in the next town over, it proprietor was none other than Sam’s old rival Rachel who wasn’t as knowledgeable as Sam when it came to Flowers.
