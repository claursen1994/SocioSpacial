The art gallery of Innsmouth was holding a special exhibition for up and coming local artists. With Innsmouth only being a small town word had gotten around quickly and as such almost the entire town was there. The Local artist’s work was on display throughout a large hall with visitors meandering past paintings and sculptures. A sculpture made of driftwood stood behind a smaller sculpture of a Whale at the centre of the hall and seemed to be generating a lot of interest from the locals. Behind the sculpture of a Whale stood a horrible piece made from washed up plastic bottles, which was not very popular among the locals. Overall the exhibition was looking to be a grand success.
