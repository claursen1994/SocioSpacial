The Torton airfield was busy this time of year. Many of the hobby pilots had taken their summer holidays at the exact same time and all wanted to fly. The resident helicopter flight instructor was somewhere above the control tower. He liked to tease the people in the control tower with stunts that looked like they would end in a crash. Not exactly legal but he loved to do it nonetheless. The tower couldn’t care less though they were dealing with a landing request from a small biplane that was having a few engine troubles but it was high above them so it had plenty of space, time and speed to be able to make a safe landing.
