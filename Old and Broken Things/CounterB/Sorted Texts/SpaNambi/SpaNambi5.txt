The local community had long considered the caves  at the bottom of the Lincoln gorge dangerous but that had never stopped the tourism industry and nor would it stop them now. An adventure holiday company had set up an entire “seasoned cavers only” activity involving a rest stop in a larger cave somewhere below the entrance. This was usually the only place tourists got to before turning back as the tunnel that went further down was a very tight squeeze. A recent geological survey of the area had determined that there should be flooded cavern above the entrance to the caves.
