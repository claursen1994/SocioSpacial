The food and wine festival was held every year on a field between the towns of Swampscott and Lynn and had been growing year on year. To the left of the entrance were several posters for the upcoming events that made the festival special. Along with the usual fare of eating competitions there were sack races, dog shows and live music. Much to the dismay or many attendees the wine drinking competition would not be held this year. Somewhere to the right of the entrance someone had forgotten their backpack behind and there were two festival organisers standing next to it discussing whether or not the backpack constituted a health and safety hazard.
