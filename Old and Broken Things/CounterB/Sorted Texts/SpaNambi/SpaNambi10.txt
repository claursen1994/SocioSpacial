The flower shop on Wensley High Street was by far the most popular shop in town. People said it had the best variety of plants on offer. To the right of display of pre-cut flowers was an arrangement of succulents and other green indoor that would change every week. It was one of the reasons why the shop was so popular, people loved the fact that they could return weekly and find something completely new. Recently a local prankster had taken to putting fake plastic plants with price tags somewhere to the left of the cut flowers, much to the dismay of anyone unfortunate enough  to accidentally purchase them.
