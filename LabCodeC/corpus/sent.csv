However  it still wasn’t enough to match the amount of money that the Dwight family had managed to raise for the chapel. This rivalry had been going on for years and had started to fray relations between everyone in the village. However, a new property developer that had just moved in wanted to grease the wheels of his business plans and so started to spend generously in the village. When Mr. Roberts donated to the chapel, he made sure he at least donated more than the Alder Family.","The old chapel doors stood wide open allowing full view of its interior. Inside there stood a magnificent alter that had been in the church for hundreds of years. To the left of the alter stood the pulpit where the pastor would often hold his sermons from. A recent Archaeological discovery has lead researchers to believe that there is a secret underground chamber somewhere to the right of the pulpit in the church. The local community considered the church an integral part of its identity, though the number of people attending had dwindled significantly over the past few years.","The old chapel relied on donations from the local community.

The two were friends and their rivalry would spur them on to climbing faster and more dangerously in order to one up each other. Amy's friend Bradley wanted to impress her. When he climbed the mountain he gave it all he had and made sure that he was at least faster than Amy. The three loved to climb and loved nature so they always made sure to pick up their rubbish wherever they went.","The mountain stood proudly as it had done for thousands of years. People had always wanted to climb it so over the years a natural rest stop had developed above the camp at the mountain’s base. The rest stop wasn’t an official one and had over the years become popular with bird watchers. They had no interest in reaching the summit as it was the birds they came for. With a recent increase in tourism on the mountain there was a rumour that somewhere below the camp at the mountain’s base there was a small area where people would go to throw their rubbish away. The mountain rangers authority found this to be completely unacceptable.Amy was a highly competent hiker and she loved to compete in time trials. She was annoyed at the fact that she hadn’t managed to climb to the mountain’s summit faster than Sam.

Mike and his two friends, Ralph and Dustin, had come from two towns over in order to participate. Mike knew that he wasn’t as good of a runner as Ralph and Ralph would often be finished for at least ten minutes by the time Mike got to the finish.

Jonathan had invited his friend Catherine to go skiing with him. Catherine was also very wealthy but not as wealthy as Jonathan.","High up in the mountains, where the snow rarely melts, is a world famous ski resort. The resort caters almost exclusively to the incredibly wealthy. It has some of the finest hotels and restaurants in the world. The slope everyone at the resort desired to be seen on was above one of the more exclusive ski lodges. People had to take a special pre booked shuttle bus to get to the lodge itself and then wait to be invited to ski on the slope. Though the lodge couldn’t actually stop anyone from skiing on the slope they were responsible for its upkeep and safety.

The resident helicopter flight instructor was somewhere above the control tower. He liked to tease the people in the control tower with stunts high in the air that looked like they would end in a crash. The tower couldn’t care less though they were dealing with a landing request from a small biplane that was having a few engine troubles but it was high above them so it had plenty of space, time and speed to be able to make a safe landing. Terry was one of the most experienced pilots in Torton, he’d been flying since he was a boy, he was in fact a far more experienced pilot than Josh who had been managing Torton Airfield for several years now. The two got along fantastically and would often go for drinks together at the pub. This year a new pilot had arrived in Torton, Aaron, an ex-stunt pilot who became a flight instructor. Aaron was not more experienced than Josh."

"168",21,8,"Dogger Bank in the North Sea is thought to be one of the most significant locations for evidence of early Neolithic settlements. There is only one problem; it is very much under water. A team of divers and archaeologists was performing a preliminary study of the area. They had sent down divers and a remote control submarine. The submarine was somewhere above the divers who were looking adjusting to the pressure before they dove lower. They hadn’t found much at this point at least nothing that was from the time period they had been hoping for. Somewhere above the submarine there was a basket attached to ropes. If the divers found anything, they could place it in the basket and the item could then be hauled up. For the most part the diving teams had been finding plastic, this was going to be a lot harder than everyone thought.","There were are a few  teams hoping to find Archaeological evidence of Dogger bank settlements that operate in the north sea.

With Innsmouth only being a small town word had gotten around quickly and as such almost the entire town was there. The Local artist’s work was on display throughout a large hall with visitors walking past paintings and sculptures. A sculpture made of driftwood stood behind a smaller sculpture of a Whale at the centre of the hall and seemed to be generating a lot of interest from the locals. Behind the sculpture of a Whale stood a horrible piece made from washed up plastic bottles, which was not very popular among the locals. Overall the exhibition was looking to be a grand success. Three business owners from Innsmouth were looking to support the local communities growing art community. They were planning to invest in the gallery.

They had almost out grown the spire of the chapel they surrounded. The Oaks towered above the yew trees .

The Birch trees also towered above the Yews and when they shed their paper like bark it was often confused with confetti left over from a wedding at the chapel.
