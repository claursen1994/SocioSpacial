The catering company tasked with providing food and refreshments for the community pool party was having problems. They had had many of their usual staff call in sick that day and were now desperately scrambling to get staff that had booked that day off to come in. Amanda was had only just returned from her holiday so wasn’t as likely to come in as Sam who was always eager to help out, besides Sammy needed the money. There was of course the option of asking Jess to come in as this wouldn’t have been her only day off so she was more likely to come in as Sammy.
