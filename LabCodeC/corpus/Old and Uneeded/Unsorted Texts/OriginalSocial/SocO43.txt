Alfred McMurphy had managed the pub ever since his father had retired several years ago. It was a family operation and always had been. Frank McMurphy wasn’t as popular with the patrons as his brother Alfred but they liked him well enough when he served the drinks and listened to their woes. Susan McMurphy also worked at the pub and was a lot more popular as her brother Alfred and was also a popular character in the community.
