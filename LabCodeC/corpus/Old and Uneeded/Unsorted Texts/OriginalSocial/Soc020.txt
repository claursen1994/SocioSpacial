The Fishermen of Rockport would often gather in the Pub by the docks and relax after a day out at sea. Today though they’d all stayed on dry land as the regatta was taking place and no one wanted them to get in the way, nor did they want to get in the way themselves, a collision could be very costly. Todd was a skilled captain and loved to buy a round of drinks for the whole pub, especially if he had made a good haul, but he wasn’t as good as Herman who seemed to have a nose for finding where the fish would be on any given day. All the rivalries out at sea were strictly taboo in the pub and they all got along, so long as no one drank too much. Herman’s son Melvin had recently purchased his own fishing boat and would head out with his own crew, though only a boy of 18 he was already a better fisherman than Todd.
