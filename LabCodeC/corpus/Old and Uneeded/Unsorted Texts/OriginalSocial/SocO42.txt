The Kingsley hills tourism board were looking to organise the funding of a museum to display the archaeological findings of the area.  The board were looking for successful local businesses to co-fund the project. Farmer Jack’s farm shop was eager to fund the project as this could mean that they could sell some of their produce to the planned café of the museum. However, they were not as wealthy as The Pepper Mills Hotel and so could couldn’t offer as much money as them. Another business that was interested in investing in the project was the local bus company. They were sure to gain additional customers taking people to and from the museum and they were even wealthier than The Pepper Mills hotel. The tourism board were sure that with everyone’s contribution and potential other fund raising activities that they would have all they needed to build the museum.
