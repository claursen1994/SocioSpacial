The two were old friends so it didn?t bother them as to who was more popular. However with the surgery?s refurbishment came an additional GP, Matthew, who?s kind nature made him very popular with the towns folk, far more popular than at least Malcom. None of this mattered to the three though as their main goal was to provide the best medical care they could to help their community.

4	1	"Benjamin, the mechanic, had only recently arrived on the island. He had been called there on the behest of his friend Allan, who was also a mechanic, in order to fix the islands lighthouse. Benjamin was not as good of a mechanic as Allan but they were sure to make a good team nonetheless. After a long day of trying to repair the lighthouse there was still much work to do to get it working. .  Allan decided to call for help. Susan, who also lived on the Island, was not as good of a mechanic as Allan but surely the three of them would complete the work faster than just the two of them. "	Spice Island lay just three nautical miles off the coast Newfoundland. The island didn?t have a great deal to offer in terms of comfort but there were a handful of people that called it home. There was a small weather station to the left the small docks used mostly to load and unload supplies as well as passengers. There was also a small supply store somewhere to the left of the docks which sold various bits and pieces. It was overpriced due to the fact that spice islanders had to import everything from the mainland. Many of them didn?t mind spending more on supplies if it meant avoiding a long trip to the mainland.

"	"The local community had long considered the caves  at the bottom of the Lincoln gorge dangerous. However, the tourist industry just kept growing. An adventure holiday company had set up a seasoned cavers activity with a rest stop in a large cave somewhere below the entrance. This was usually the only place tourists got to before turning back as the tunnel that went further down was a very tight squeeze. A recent geological survey of the area had determined that there should be a previously undiscovered cavern above the entrance to the caves.

Mike knew that he wasn?t as good of a runner as Ralph and Ralph would often be finished for at least ten minutes by the time Mike got to the finish. Dustin was a relatively new friend of theirs having only joined their company a few months ago, but they absolutely loved his company. As soon as the marathon began it became apparent that Dustin, like Ralph was a much better runner than Mike. This was going to be another tough one for Mike. "	"The marathon was held every year in Dunwich. Every runner had to have a charity for which they were running.  Most of the time the runners that ran for a big charity would run in a group together in order to stand out more for the crowds that gathered along the roads.

The runners from the cancer charity knew they were infront of the runners from the hospice, which encouraged them. It would be a spectacular finish with a great deal of money raised for charity."

Mike knew that he wasn?t as good of a runner as Ralph and Ralph would often be finished for at least ten minutes by the time Mike got to the finish. Dustin was a relatively new friend of theirs having only joined their company a few months ago, but they absolutely loved his company. As soon as the marathon began it became apparent that Dustin, like Ralph was a much better runner than Mike. This was going to be another tough one for Mike. "	"The marathon was held every year in Dunwich. Every runner had to have a charity for which they were running.  Most of the time the runners that ran for a big charity would run in a group together in order to stand out more for the crowds that gathered along the roads.  The Runners of the local hospice knew they were behind the runners of the wildlife charity. It didn?t matter who won of course so long as money was raised and everyone had fun. The runners from the cancer charity knew they were behind of the runners from the hospice, which encouraged them. It would be a spectacular finish with a great deal of money raised for charity.

He knew that his university rival, Thom, would be skiing at the same resort as him and it made him very happy to know that his net worth was now, way above Thom?s. Jonathan had invited his friend Catherine to go skiing with him. Catherine was also very wealthy but not as wealthy as Jonathan. "	"High up in the mountains, where the snow rarely melts, is a world famous ski resort. The resort caters almost exclusively to the incredibly wealthy. It has some of the finest hotels and restaurants in the world. The slope everyone at the resort desired to be seen on was above one of the more exclusive ski lodges. People had to take a special pre booked shuttle bus to get to the lodge itself and then wait to be invited to ski on the slope. Though the lodge couldn?t actually stop anyone from skiing on the slope they were responsible for its upkeep and safety. A child has gone missing below the start of the slope and hadn?t been seen in several hours. "	"Jonathan had been looking forward to his skiing trip for a while now.

The three would spend their summer riding around the village on their bikes. They loved to ride around together. Their parents didn?t like the three playing together, they were far more concerned as to what people thought about them. Joanna?s family wasn?t as well respected as Peter?s due to Joanna?s brother turning to crime a few years ago and going to prison. Sally?s family was also not as well respected as Peter?s family. However, none of this ever bothered the three at all. No matter what was done or said to them they always found a way to spend the entire summer together. "	"The village of Northport didn?t offer that much in terms of regular amusement but it had some of the best camping around, especially in the summer.  Behind the rows of summer lodges was a stream where kids from the village would spend their entire summer. They often played with those that had come to Northport for the camping. Many friendships were forged in and around that stream. In front of the summer lodges stood a monument to a dog that had saved his owners life during a bear attack at the cost of its own.

12	1	"Terry was one of the most experienced pilots in Torton, he?d been flying since he was a boy, he was in fact a far more experienced pilot than Josh who had been managing Torton Airfield for several years now. The two got along fantastically and would often go for drinks together at the pub. This year a new pilot had arrived in Torton, Aaron, an ex-stunt pilot who became a flight instructor. Jerry had a great deal more experience than Josh. "	"The Torton airfield was busy this time of year. Many of the hobby pilots had taken their summer holidays at the exact same time and all wanted to fly. The resident helicopter flight instructor was somewhere above the control tower. He liked to tease the people in the control tower with stunts high in the air that looked like they would end in a crash. The tower couldn?t care less though they were dealing with a landing request from a small biplane that was having a few engine troubles but it was high above them so it had plenty of space, time and speed to be able to make a safe landing.

Toby was relatively new to the trade but was a good worker none the less, he obviously wasn?t as good as Daren but he would still be a valuable asset while working on the 3 jobs."	"The metal workshop on Yew street had been there in one form or another since the 1500s and as a result had expanded and grown over the many years of operation.  In front of a modern lathe stood a desk with a chair that was used as a mini office. This place was more about metal work than paper work but paper work had to be done nonetheless. Workers had recently noticed some small corners of paper had been chewed off which made them suspect that there was a, or perhaps many mice living in front of the desk. It couldn?t be behind of the desk simply because that concrete had only recently been repaired.

Darius was happy, while it was true that he hadn?t received as big of bonus as Linda, he was still happy that he would be able to pay off a large proportion of his mortgage. Lucy was also happy with her bonus; she had received more than Darius and was already planning the extravagant holiday she would go on. "	"The mine had been a source of copper for almost 50 years. It wasn?t particularly big, the company that owned it was small and couldn?t afford to expand. Instead they enjoyed a steady stream of revenue and a constant influx of highly skilled workers that would use the small mine as a way to up their experience in the industry. Shaft A was currently the most profitable shaft and was situated somewhere below Shaft B which had run dry a few years ago and was now used as a storage area. A recent exploratory drilling somewhere above Shaft A and had revealed a good deposit of a very copper rich ore.

17	1	"The town of Rockport boasted three major events that always drew in large amounts of crowds as well as a few other smaller events that took place there, usually in the summer. The Folk music festival drew in a much larger crowd than the Rockport Grand Prix but both were still popular and brought in a lot of money to the town. The Sailing festival was also more popular the Rockport Grand Prix. Rockport was one of the most up and coming towns in the area and the events were beginning to draw in crowds from further and further afield. "	The Rockport Grand Prix was anything but grand. It was a race track for the under 15s and none of the cars could even go over 40 miles per hour. Not that they would even be able to each such a speed as the course featured many twists and turns so the soapbox like cars had to go slowly to avoid crashing. The Blue team was one of the best in Rockport and was currently in front of the Red team. The coaches were happy about this as they had to beat the Red and Green team to qualify for the finals. The Green team were also ahead of the Reds. The Grand Prix was always a popular event in Rockport and would draw in onlookers from miles around.

The Folk music festival drew in a much larger crowd than the Rockport Grand Prix but both were still popular and brought in a lot of money to the town. The Sailing festival was also more popular the Rockport Grand Prix. Rockport was one of the most up and coming towns in the area and the events were beginning to draw in crowds from further and further afield. "	"The Rockport Grand Prix was anything but grand. It was a race track for the under 15s and none of the cars could even go over 40 miles per hour. Not that they would even be able to each such a speed as the course featured many twists and turns so the soapbox like cars had to go slowly to avoid crashing. The Blue team was one of the best in Rockport and was currently in front of the Red team. The coaches were happy about this as they had to beat the Red and Green team to qualify for the finals. The Green team were behind of the Reds. The Grand Prix was always a popular event in Rockport and would draw in onlookers from miles around.

18	1	"The Kingsley hills tourism board were looking to organise the funding of a museum to display the archaeological findings of the area.  The board were looking for successful local businesses to co-fund the project. Farmer Jack?s farm shop was eager to fund the project as this could mean that they could sell some of their produce to the planned caf? of the museum. However, they were not as wealthy as The Pepper Mills Hotel and so could couldn?t offer as much money as them. Another business that was interested in investing in the project was the local bus company. They were sure to gain additional customers taking people to and from the museum but they too were not as wealthy as the Pepper Mills hotel. The tourism board were sure that with everyone?s contribution and potential other fund raising activities that they would have all they needed to build the museum."	The Kingsley hills were deemed an area of great archaeological importance. There was a small rest stop somewhere below  a small fully excavated dig site. The site had yielded many interesting finds that shed light on the daily lives of early Anglo-Saxon settlers in England. Somewhere downhill of this site was a small patch of grass that never grew quite as tall as the grass around it. This was thought to be evidence of another point of interest and a potential dig site. The archaeological work in the hills was often suspended in the summer due to the influx of tourists to the hills.

20	8	The annual sailing festival had started as it always did with the sailing regatta. Three teams from Rockport had entered the regatta in the hopes that they would get some pay off for the weeks of training they had undertaken. The crew of the the Royal Lady had managed to get a good start but were behind the the King Fisher?s crew. The weather was perfect for sailing that day and made for much better conditions than the previous years. The third crew from Rockport on the boat the Fast Kitten were behind of the the Royal Lady This was going to be an exciting race and the locals cheered on the crews from Rockport as they sailed past them. 	"The Fishermen of Rockport would often gather in the Pub by the docks and relax after a day out at sea. Today though they?d all stayed on dry land as the regatta was taking place and no one wanted to get in the way. Todd was a skilled captain and loved to buy a round of drinks for the whole pub, especially if he had made a good haul. Although he wasn?t as good as Herman who seemed to have a nose for finding where the fish would be on any given day.

21	1	There were are a few  teams hoping to find Archaeological evidence of Dogger bank settlements that operate in the north sea. The Norwegians have much more funding than the British and their equipment is proof of this as it?s some of the most modern equipment on the market. This didn?t mean that anyone was actively working against each other though. The Danish teams also have less funding than the Norwegians but they still share their findings with everyone just as the British do. 	"Dogger Bank in the North Sea is thought to be one of the most significant locations for evidence of early Neolithic settlements. There is only one problem; it is very much under water. A team of divers and archaeologists was performing a preliminary study of the area. They had sent down divers and a remote control submarine. The submarine was somewhere above the divers who were looking adjusting to the pressure before they dove lower. They hadn?t found much at this point at least nothing that was from the time period they had been hoping for. Somewhere below the submarine there was a basket attached to ropes. If the divers found anything, they could place it in the basket and the item could then be hauled up. For the most part the diving teams had been finding plastic, this was going to be a lot harder than everyone thought.

For the most part the diving teams had been finding plastic, this was going to be a lot harder than everyone thought.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 There were are a few  teams hoping to find Archaeological evidence of Dogger bank settlements that operate in the north sea. The Norwegians have much more funding than the British and their equipment is proof of this as it?s some of the most modern equipment on the market. This didn?t mean that anyone was actively working against each other though. The Danish teams also have less funding than the Norwegians but they still share their findings with everyone just as the British do. "

There was of course the option of asking Jess to come in but this would have been her only day off so she also wasn?t as likely to come in as Sammy.

To the right of the pool?s ladder was the water filter which had been inspected and cleaned before the event. Staff wanted to be sure that everything was up to scratch. The pool was in a better condition than ever this year due to refurbishments that had finished just before summer, the whole staff were very pleased with the results. Though one thing that was overlooked was a small paving slab that had come loose somewhere to the right of the pool?s ladder. Hopefully no one would trip over it.

Fred who owned a small Caf? by the beach was hoping to get his hands on some driftwood pieces that he could display at his caf?. He wasn?t going to be able to pledge as much Money as Geraldine who was trying to be elected as Mayor. Simon was also looking to pledge a decent amount of money to the gallery was also able to double the amount that Geraldine was planning on giving. 	"The art gallery of Innsmouth was holding a special exhibition for up and coming local artists. With Innsmouth only being a small town word had gotten around quickly and as such almost the entire town was there. The Local artist?s work was on display throughout a large hall with visitors walking past paintings and sculptures. A sculpture made of driftwood stood behind a smaller sculpture of a Whale at the centre of the hall and seemed to be generating a lot of interest from the locals. Behind the sculpture of a Whale stood a horrible piece made from washed up plastic bottles, which was not very popular among the locals. Overall the exhibition was looking to be a grand success.

The art gallery of Innsmouth was holding a special exhibition for up and coming local artists. With Innsmouth only being a small town word had gotten around quickly and as such almost the entire town was there. The Local artist?s work was on display throughout a large hall with visitors walking past paintings and sculptures. A sculpture made of driftwood stood behind a smaller sculpture of a Whale at the centre of the hall and seemed to be generating a lot of interest from the locals. Behind the sculpture of a Whale stood a horrible piece made from washed up plastic bottles, which was not very popular among the locals. Overall the exhibition was looking to be a grand success. "

The art gallery of Innsmouth was holding a special exhibition for up and coming local artists. With Innsmouth only being a small town word had gotten around quickly and as such almost the entire town was there. The Local artist?s work was on display throughout a large hall with visitors walking past paintings and sculptures. A sculpture made of driftwood stood behind a smaller sculpture of a Whale at the centre of the hall and seemed to be generating a lot of interest from the locals. Behind the sculpture of a Whale stood a horrible piece made from washed up plastic bottles, which was not very popular among the locals. Overall the exhibition was looking to be a grand success. "

The two had been together for years and both came from families where people considered themselves the ?Heart and Soul? of the party. Aaron?s father Gary was a great storyteller, much more so than Aaron was. Josephine also loved to spin yarns but wasn?t as good as Gary. The wedding reception and ceremony was bound to be a battleground of sorts as to who would tell the best story."	"The cemetery was old and within it many trees grew. They had almost out grown the spire of the chapel they surrounded. The Oaks towered above the yew trees . The trees that grew in the cemetery gave plenty of shade so it was never too hot for those that visited their passed relatives in the summer. The Birch trees also towered above the Yews and when they shed their paper like bark it was often confused with confetti left over from a wedding at the chapel. This was a popular spot for weddings, as the trees and the old stonework provided a beautiful backdrop for photos.
