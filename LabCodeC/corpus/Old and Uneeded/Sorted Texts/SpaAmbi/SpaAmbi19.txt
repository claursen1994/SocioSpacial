McMurphy’s Pub was one of the best in Amherst. Due to its popularity, the owners had decided to add additional seating so that they could serve more customers than ever before. To the right of the central row of tables was the bar, which was almost as long as the whole pub itself. There were barstools along the whole bar and were considered to be the best seats in the house. To the left of the bar was an old jukebox that played records from the 70s and 80s. On a Friday night the place was absolutely full, especially if it was one of the bi-weekly live music nights.
