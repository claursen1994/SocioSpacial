Spice Island lay just three nautical miles east off the coast Newfoundland. The island didn’t have a great deal to offer in terms of comfort but there were a handful of people that called it home. There was a small weather station to the left the small docks used mostly to load and unload supplies as well as passengers. There was also a small supply store somewhere to the left of the docks which sold various bits and pieces. It was overpriced due to the fact that spice islanders had to import everything from the mainland but many of them didn’t mind spending a lot more for a coffee if it kept them warm during the day.
