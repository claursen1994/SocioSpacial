The cemetery was old and within it many trees grew. They had almost out grown the spire of the chapel they surrounded. The Oaks towered above the yew trees that had been planted there almost 150 years ago. The trees that grew in the cemetery gave plenty of shade so it was never too hot for those that visited their passed relatives in the summer. The Birch trees also towered above the Yews and when they shed their paper like bark it was often confused as confetti left over from a wedding at the chapel. This was a popular spot for weddings, as the trees and the old stonework provided a beautiful backdrop for photos.
