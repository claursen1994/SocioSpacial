The mine had been a source of copper for almost 50 years. It wasn’t particularly big, the company that owned it was small and couldn’t afford to expand, instead they enjoyed a steady stream of revenue and a constant influx of highly skilled workers that would use the small mine as a way to up their experience in the industry. Shaft A was currently the most profitable shaft and was situated somewhere below Shaft B which had run dry a few years ago and was now used as a storage area. A recent exploratory drill somewhere below Shaft A and had revealed a good deposit of chalcocite which was a very copper rich ore.
