Sunnydale high school was like any other high school. It was filled with tightly knit groups of friends bound together by their favourite activities. The basketball group was quite popular even more popular than the football group. This may have been down to their recent win streak against their rival high school, which had put them well on their way to the regional basketball finals. On another hand the art club had recently also exploded in popularity due to their incredibly successful summer exhibition which drew crowds from all over town. It was apparent that their popularity had surpassed that of the basketball group . The groups weren’t technically rival groups, but their popularity would influence where the school board would allocate the most funding for the next year.
