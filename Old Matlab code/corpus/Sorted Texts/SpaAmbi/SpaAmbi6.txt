The A67 highway was one of the longest roads in the country. It spanned almost all of it, and ran over the river Stig. Heading to Innsmouth from  Ipswich one have to cross the bridge over the river. Somewhere before this there was a rest stop that offered travellers bed and breakfast. It was a popular place and saw a great many visitors, it was a profitable place to own. There had been recent reports of a traffic stop and search operation by the police somewhere before reaching the bridge that had been set up due to the large amounts of drugs being smuggled in the area.
