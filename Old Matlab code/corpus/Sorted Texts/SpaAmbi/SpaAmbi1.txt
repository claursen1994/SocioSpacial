The old chapel doors stood wide open allowing full view of its interior. Inside there stood a magnificent alter that had been in the church for hundreds of years. To the left of the alter stood the pulpit where the pastor would often hold his sermons from. A recent Archaeological discovery has lead researchers to believe that there is a secret underground chamber somewhere to the right of the pulpit in the church. The local community considered the church an integral part of the community, though the number of people attending had dwindled significantly over the past few years.
