The annual sailing festival had started as it always did with the sailing regatta. Three teams from Rockport had entered the regatta in the hopes that they would get some pay off for the weeks of training they had undertaken. The crew of the “The Iroquois Lady” had managed to get a good start but were behind the “The King Charles” crew. The weather was perfect for sailing that day and made for much better conditions than the previous years. The third crew from Rockport on the boat “The Fast Kitten” were behind of the “The Iroquois Lady”. This was going to be an exciting race and the locals cheered on the crews from Rockport as they sailed past them.
