The Rockport Grand Prix was anything but grand. It was a race track for the under 15s and none of the cars could even go over 40 miles per hour. Not that they would even be able to each such a speed as the course featured many twists and turns so the soapbox like cars had to go slowly to avoid crashing. The Blue team was one of the best in Rockport and was currently in front of the Red team. The coaches were happy about this as they had to beat the Red and Green team to qualify for the finals. The Green team were behind of the Reds. The Grand Prix was always a popular event in Rockport and would draw in onlookers from miles around.
