The town of Rockport boasted three major events that always drew in large amounts of crowds as well as a few other smaller events that took place there, usually in the summer. The Folk music festival drew in a much larger crowd than the Rockport Grand Prix but both were still popular and brought in a lot of money to the town. The Sailing festival was also more popular the Rockport Grand Prix. Rockport was one of the most up and coming towns in the area and the events were beginning to draw in crowds from further and further afield.
